0,Afghanistan,35,1,1,,21.5,"Afghanistan adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015, for the period 2015-2018 and 2019-2022, to be implemented in two phases. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which serves as the head of the Steering Committee that will work in collaboration with other government agencies, civil society, and international organisations for the NAP'ss implementation and monitoring. The NAP was  developed to address the challenges women face in the aftermath of war and conflict in Afghanistan, and is organised under the primary pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation, protection, prevention, and relief and recovery. Nevertheless, the NAP does not address disarmament issues, nor does it connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity, despite the fact that the implementation of the NAP is being undertaken within the context of the ongoing conflict . Additionally, there have been numerous difficulties in terms of resourcing the implementation of the NAP. Afghanistan reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others: Comparative analysis of year 2016-17 to 2018 shows that remarkable progress has been made towards adopting and implementing NAP for women, peace and security … Security situation has changed significantly for better in period at national and regional levels, finances and allocations of budgets are completed in 2017 for implementing the plan. Capacity building of points for NAP completed in 2017 with technical assistance from UNWOMEN. Provincial resourcing saw slow progress because of finalizing of national financing mechanism. However, 2017 Status Report on the Afghanistan'ss National Action Plan shows considerable Policy coordination came through the formation of steering committees and their meetings on quarterly basis. (p. 81) The High Peace Council (HPC) reports in the 2017 Status Report on the Afghanistan'ss National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 that their five-year strategic plan center'ss around women'ss participation in peace, reconciliation and reintegration in Afghanistan. In addition to the achievements mentioned above, Ministry of Women'ss Affairs (MoWA) reported that there is a roster of 66 women covering 34 provinces in Afghanistan. The women on the roster participated in peace negotiations with the armed opposition both in Afghanistan and abroad. (pp. 81-82). Afghanistan has experienced varying forms of armed conflict since the past five decades, including civil wars and the US invasion of the country in 2001. Under the Taliban regime , which lasted from 1996 until 2001, women were banned from participating in public life, including access to education, healthcare, and employment. While women made a number of gains after the collapse of the Taliban regime, women'ss meaningful participation in the Afghan peace process, as well as not backsliding on human rights, including women'ss rights, is of critical importance. During the 23 rounds of peace talks between 2005 and 2014, women were included at the peace table in only two occasions. Furthermore, the negotiating team that was announced after the November 2018 conference in Geneva had three women, but no civil society representatives. Women were excluded from the US-Taliban talks throughout 2019, as were issues of women'ss rights, leading to widespread concern among Afghan women that their human rights would be compromised for the sake of an agreement. In 2020, there were four women among the 21-member government negotiating team in the intra-Afghan talks. In 2019, Afghanistan was among the top 15 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 20% increase in its military spending. Additionally, in 2019, Afghanistan was among the top 30 largest importers of arms.",2003,,2020,227M,"NAP Development
The Steering Committee is the body responsible for the NAP development process where there is a civil society representative. In the drafting stage, civil society conducted several meetings with the Steering Committee and the Technical Working Group to review and provide substantive comments and inputs. No further detail is given to specify the nature of the role played by a civil society representative.
WILPF did not have a country section in Afghanistan at the time of the adoption of 2015 NAP and therefore was not involved in the development process of Afghanistan's NAP.
The development of the NAP was initiated in coordination with civil society, and conducted through the establishment of the following structures:
Steering Committee with the Minister of Foreign Affairs as the Chairperson Member;
Technical Working Group representatives from international organizations and foreign diplomatic missions in Kabul;
Drafting Committee;
Coordination Committee.
NAP Implementation
 While there is no clear reference on the mechanism for civil society involvement, the NAP text lists civil society as one of the agencies to be fully or partially responsible for conducting specific actions. For instance, under the Strategic Objective ""Enhancing Women'ss meaningful participation in the reconciliation, negotiation, and re‐integration at all levels"", civil society organisations are assigned the action of ""Establish a national roaster of potential women negotiators from all 34 provinces"". 
The NAP is a government policy and a reflection of government'ss commitments with regards to the implementation of UNSCR 1325. Lead implementing agencies are government agencies, ministries, structures and institutions, while civil society, media and the private sector play an important role as the supporting agencies.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
There is no clear reference for how civil society will be involved in the monitoring and evaluation process. However, the government recognises the important role of civil society as an independent oversight body for the successful implementation of the NAP.
A separate Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Plan is designed, which includes annual monitoring, mid-term (after two years) and final review (Evaluation) in the fourth year. The M&E Plan will include tracking and monitoring of financing for the NAP to ensure transparent and effective implementation, for which the Steering Committee is responsible. ","The NAP spans over two phases of four year period each, and the actions in the matrix section of the NAP are linked to specific time frames. The phase one will cover 2015‐2018 and phase two will cover 2019‐2022. Also, for each strategic objective, there is a time frame set to denote in which phase the objective actions should be achieved.","The Afghan NAP is organised under the main UNSCR1325 themes: Participation, Protection, Prevention and Relief and Recovery. Each theme has a number of strategic objectives distributed across specific areas of work. For instance, under participation, there are the following objectives distributed across Civil Service, Security and Peace and Reintegration:
Objective 1: Increased meaningful participation of women in the decision making and executive levels of the Civil Service, Security and Peace and Reintegration
Objective 2: Strengthening women'ss active participation in national and provincial elections.
Under each of these objectives there is a number of strategic objectives followed by a number of specific action, expected results, indicators, reporting mechanism, time frame and implementing agencies.","Each Strategic Objective of the Afghan NAP includes a series of actions for practically achieving these goals. For instance, under the Prevention theme Strategic Objective 1: Protection of women through implementation and monitoring of EVAW law,anti‐human trafficking and abduction law, there are the following actions:
Develop and implement of a monitoring mechanism on implementation of EVAW law, anti-human trafficking and abduction law.
Strengthen the justice sector to effectively and efficiently address the VAW cases with special focus on prosecution office and courts.","The annual reporting by the lead agencies will be prepared on the basis of indicators, templates, activities and their specific responsibilities. For each objective, there is an assigned quantitative indicator. The NAP lists quantitative indicators to track the progress of objectives and activities. For instance, for strategic objective ""Increased awareness among all military personnel on how to protect women from violence"" the specific indicator is ""Number of military personnel briefed on how to protect women from sexual violence and number of commanders informed of their responsibility to protect women."" In total, there are 39 quantitative indicators listed in the NAP.","The Steering Committee has a central role in the monitoring and evaluation process for the NAP. separate Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) Plan is designed, which includes annual monitoring, mid‐term (after two years) and final review (Evaluation) in the fourth year. The M&E Plan will include tracking and monitoring of financing for the NAP to ensure transparent and effective implementation, for which the Steering Committee is responsible. The GIRoA recognizes the important role of civil society as an independent oversight body for the successful implementation of the NAP.","The Afghan NAP does not include an allocated or estimated budget and there are no other financial resource consideration references within the NAP. However, it does note that the absence of dedicated funding is a key concern for successful NAP implementation and accountability.When budgeting/costing the NAP, the Steering Committee should encourage national and international donors to commit to funding for the duration of the NAP.
Throughout the course of implementation attention should be focused on seeking and raising funds from multiple national and international sources. The Steering Committee should also work to increase the available funds to the NAP through the annual national government budget. The budget should also contain a contingency plan, and some margins for each expected budget line that will be used when limitations in funding occur. The NAP budget should be revised on an annual basis if needed and necessary adjustments should be made.
Also, under Relief and Recovery pillar, Objective 2: Adequate financial resources are available for activities related to women in emergency, the NAP stresses that analysis of national budget should be through a gender lens.","Afghanistan's NAP does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women's insecurity.","Ministry of Women's Affairs: Institutional mechanisms

1,Albania,6,1,1,61.9,24.2,"Albania adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2020 and its most recent for the period 2023-2027. The 2018 NAP was developed by a number of ministries, including the Ministries of Internal Affairs; Europe and Foreign Affairs; and Health and Social Protection, through a participatory approach that included consultations with the representatives of local authorities, Netherlands, Sweden, UN Women, OSCE, the European Union, and civil society organizations. The main objectives of the NAP are listed as improving policy documents and raising awareness on UNSCR 1325; increasing the participation of women in the field of security at home and abroad; establishing a regulatory framework and capacities that enable better protection and rehabilitation of women in the field of peace and security; and taking measures for better monitoring and reporting of Resolution 1325. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators as well as including a detailed budget for implementation. Albania became a parliamentary republic in 1992 after four decades of communist rule. The most recent armed conflict in Albania'ss history was the 1997 civil unrest, which ensued from the collapse of informal market institutions, known as pyramid schemes , that promised high-interest returns on investments. The unrest resulted in over 2,000 casualties as well as the overthrow of the government. The country'ss protracted economic instability has had direct repercussions for women. Despite the fact that the country'ss law recognizes women'ss equal right to property and land ownership on paper, in 2018, only 8% of women in Albania owned land due to women'ss marginalization in economic matters and lack of implementation of laws.",1994,20,2014,198M,"NAP Development
The drafting and developmental process for the NAP 1325 were provided by UN Women, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Delegation of the European Union to Albania, and The Coalition for Resolution 1325, which was established by civil society organisations (CSOs), funded by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the UN Women ""Fund for Gender Equality” and implemented by the Association for Women with Social Problems (AWSP), and the Albanian Women'ss Empowerment Network (AWEN). 
WILPF Albania did not participate in the development process of the first Albanian NAP.
The Government of Albania, the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA), the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (MoEFA), the Ministry of Defence (MoD), and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP), were the lead agencies in the development process of Albania's NAP. Encouragement, expertise and technical assistance for the preparation of the document were provided by the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Sweden, through the offices of their diplomatic missions in Albania.
NAP Implementation
Specialised civil society organisations will be present in the process of NAP implementation, including: Coalition for Resolution 1325, Operation 1325, Albanian Women'ss Empowerment Network, Association for Women with Social Problems (AWSP), Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Tirana, International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, Local Security Government Units, and OSCE. Although civil society is being utilised throughout all of the objectives, they will mostly be involved in helping implement the activities outlined in Objective 1 on improving policy documents and raising awareness.
The Ministry of Defense (MoD), Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA), Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs (MoEFA) and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP) are listed as institutions responsible for implementing the various activities and objectives outlined in the Action Plan. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by several CSO'ss specialised in Resolution 1325, such as Coalition for Resolution 1325, Operation 1325, Albanian Women'ss Empowerment Network, and Association of Women in Security and Peace.
The MoEFA, MoIA, MoD, MOHSP, in cooperation with CSOs specialised in Resolution 1325 will establish a working group to review the current Action Plan and to draft future National Plans for Implementation of Resolution 1325. The MoEFA, MoIA, MoD will also draft monitoring reports by CSOs that support Resolution 1325.",The implementation period for the Albanian National Plan of Action is three years (2018-2020).,"The main objective of the NAP is the implementation and monitoring of Resolution 1325 through its promotion at every level: - local, through the prevention of any crisis situation and the strengthening of public awareness; - national, as part of the government program; - as well as international, through active involvement of the country in international activities. The main objectives are:
improving policy documents and raising awareness on Resolution 1325;
increasing the participation of women in the field of security at home and abroad;
establishing a regulatory framework and capacities that enable better protection and rehabilitation of women in the field of peace and security;
taking measures for better monitoring and reporting of Resolution 1325.","Each area of work has different actions assigned. For example, Objective 1.1: ""Strengthen integration of a gender perspective through internal rules of procedure in national security and defense and participation in national and international  activities for the implementation of Resolution 1325”  includes several actions:
Review existing national security and defense rules of procedure on the integration of a gender perspective in line with Resolution 1325
Integrate a gender perspective into the international activities of the country and report on participation in these activities from a gender perspective
Conduct awareness-raising campaigns on women's rights and legislation on gender equality, violence, peace and security
Ensure increased representation of women officers at conferences/workshops and at the 7th Annual Conference of Women in Police as well as at the Annual Conference of the International Association of Women Police
Increase participation of women in Armed Forces structures in peacekeeping missions outside of the country, respectively, in conferences and seminars","Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, Objective 2.1: ""Inclusion of a gender balance in security sector activities” includes several indicators:
Number of women appointed to top positions;
Number of women added to relevant structures;
Number of women promoted; the level they had and the highest rank they were promoted to leadership positions within the security sector.
 ","Reports within the National Action Plan will be sent to the Integrated Policy Management Group. The annual report will then be submitted for approval to the Gender Equality Council. Those responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan will be the gender equality employees in the line ministries and institutions who collect data and identify gaps in information that is needed.
The Action Plan foresees publication of six-month progress reports and will provide support for the monitoring reports of the coalition of civil society organisations for Resolution 1325. At the policy level, monitoring of the NAP will be realised through an inter-institutional group that will be established with senior political representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Interior, Europe and Foreign Affairs, as well as the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, that holds meetings every 6 months. A representative of the CSO's  Coalition for Women, Peace and Security Agenda will participate in the meetings at the political level.
The monitoring and evaluation of the NAP will be carried out by an Implementation and Coordination Group (ICG), which will monitor, evaluate and report on the Action Plan. The ICG is comprised of technical representatives from line ministries, the institutions responsible for implementing this Action Plan, as well as a representative from the Coalition of civil society organisations for Resolution 1325 engaged in the women, peace and security agenda.
MoHSP will coordinate the data collection process from all gender officers at the institutions involved.","The Action Plan includes a  detailed budget with a breakdown of the cost of the implementation. The overall cost of implementing the NAP is 280,781,916 Lek. Depending on the type of activity, the Action Plan has specified sources of funding: the state budget will cover 83.3% of activities lined out in the NAP and 2.6% will be funded from donors who will fund the implementation of specific activities. Funding needs are at 14.1% of the total cost, or 39.7 million Lek. ","Albania's NAP does not discuss disarmament issues despite the recent conflicts that have affected women, children, and the civilian population in general.","Criminal Code Articles 100 to 108: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

Albania - the United Kingdom 'Deepening bilateral cooperation in areas of common interest': Regional Initiatives

Meeting of Donors To fund their National Action Plan NAP: Prevention

",1,Eastern Europe & Central Asia,"Albania adopted its first National Action Plan NAP in 2018 for the period 2018-2020 and its most recent for the period 2023-2027. The 2018 NAP was developed by a number of ministries, including the Ministries of Internal Affairs; Europe and Foreign Affairs; and Health and Social Protection, through a participatory approach that included consultations with the representatives of local authorities, Netherlands, Sweden, UN Women, OSCE, the European Union, and civil society organizations. The main objectives of the NAP are listed as improving policy documents and raising awareness on UNSCR 1325; increasing the participation of women in the field of security at home and abroad; establishing a regulatory framework and capacities that enable better protection and rehabilitation of women in the field of peace and security; and taking measures for better monitoring and reporting of Resolution 1325. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators as well as including a detailed budget for implementation. Albania became a parliamentary republic in 1992 after four decades of communist rule. The most recent armed conflict in Albania'ss history was the 1997 civil unrest, which ensued from the collapse of informal market institutions, known as pyramid schemes , that promised high-interest returns on investments. The unrest resulted in over 2,000 casualties as well as the overthrow of the government. The country'ss protracted economic instability has had direct repercussions for women. Despite the fact that the country'ss law recognizes women'ss equal right to property and land ownership on paper, in 2018, only 8 of women in Albania owned land due to women'ss marginalization in economic matters and lack of implementation of laws. The main objective of the NAP is the implementation and monitoring of Resolution 1325 through its promotion at every level: - local, through the prevention of any crisis situation and the strengthening of public awareness; - national, as part of the government program; - as well as international, through active involvement of the country in international activities. The main objectives are: improving policy documents and raising awareness on Resolution 1325; increasing the participation of women in the field of security at home and abroad; establishing a regulatory framework and capacities that enable better protection and rehabilitation of women in the field of peace and security; taking measures for better monitoring and reporting of Resolution 1325. Each area of work has different actions assigned. For example, Objective 1.1: ""Strengthen integration of a gender perspective through internal rules of procedure in national security and defense and participation in national and international activities for the implementation of Resolution 1325 includes several actions: Review existing national security and defense rules of procedure on the integration of a gender perspective in line with Resolution 1325 Integrate a gender perspective into the international activities of the country and report on participation in these activities from a gender perspective Conduct awareness-raising campaigns on women's rights and legislation on gender equality, violence, peace and security Ensure increased representation of women officers at conferencesworkshops and at the 7th Annual Conference of Women in Police as well as at the Annual Conference of the International Association of Women Police Increase participation of women in Armed Forces structures in peacekeeping missions outside of the country, respectively, in conferences and seminars Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, Objective 2.1: ""Inclusion of a gender balance in security sector activities includes several indicators: Number of women appointed to top positions; Number of women added to relevant structures; Number of women promoted; the level they had and the highest rank they were promoted to leadership positions within the security sector. Reports within the National Action Plan will be sent to the Integrated Policy Management Group. The annual report will then be submitted for approval to the Gender Equality Council. Those responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan will be the gender equality employees in the line ministries and institutions who collect data and identify gaps in information that is needed. The Action Plan foresees publication of six-month progress reports and will provide support for the monitoring reports of the coalition of civil society organisations for Resolution 1325. At the policy level, monitoring of the NAP will be realised through an inter-institutional group that will be established with senior political representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Interior, Europe and Foreign Affairs, as well as the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, that holds meetings every 6 months. A representative of the CSO's Coalition for Women, Peace and Security Agenda will participate in the meetings at the political level. The monitoring and evaluation of the NAP will be carried out by an Implementation and Coordination Group ICG, which will monitor, evaluate and report on the Action Plan. The ICG is comprised of technical representatives from line ministries, the institutions responsible for implementing this Action Plan, as well as a representative from the Coalition of civil society organisations for Resolution 1325 engaged in the women, peace and security agenda. MoHSP will coordinate the data collection process from all gender officers at the institutions involved. The Action Plan includes a detailed budget with a breakdown of the cost of the implementation. The overall cost of implementing the NAP is 280,781,916 Lek. Depending on the type of activity, the Action Plan has specified sources of funding: the state budget will cover 83.3 of activities lined out in the NAP and 2.6 will be funded from donors who will fund the implementation of specific activities. Funding needs are at 14.1 of the total cost, or 39.7 million Lek. Albania's NAP does not discuss disarmament issues despite the recent conflicts that have affected women, children, and the civilian population in general."

3,Angola,25,1,1,39.2,21.5,"Angola adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The NAP was developed by the Ministry for Family and Promotion of Women and the Ministry of National Defense and Interior. The NAP does not mention civil society involvement in the NAP development process, but does include civil society as a responsible entity for the implementation of certain objectives. The NAP has six overall objectives, including increasing women'ss participation in peacebuilding processes; providing women and girls with training on peacebuilding processes, including on gender equality; promoting and protecting the rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict settings; raising awareness about the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda; and gender-responsive budgeting. Each objective has corresponding actions as well as an allocated budget. Angola reported on the implementation of its NAP and the WPS Agenda in its national reporting (available only in Portuguese) for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, following a 15-year war for liberation. Women played a key role in the liberation war through the Organisation of Angolan Women and the Independent League for Angolan Women. Angola also experienced a civil war, which lasted from 1975 until 2002, and ended with the signing of the Luena Memorandum of Understanding . Women were excluded from the peace process, and despite the existence of a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) program, women combatants were not provided with any benefits. These long-term armed conflicts have had a disproportionate impact on women, as women constitute approximately eighty percent of the internally displaced people. At the multilateral level, Angola most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2015-2016.",,,,,"NAP Development
Specific civil society organisations have not been explicitly mentioned as being involved in the development phase. Nevertheless, one of the many  objectives of the NAP is to increase the participation of civil society in the implementation of UNSCR 1325 by educating civil society on the WPS Agenda.
WILPF does not have a country section in Angola and therefore was not involved in the development process of Angola's NAP.
NAP Implementation
On an institutional level civil society are included as responsible agents for the implementation of the NAP. The Ministries that created the NAP along with other relevant Ministerial Departments are included as the main responsible actors for the implementation of the NAP. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation

 ","For the policies recommended for the period of 2017-2020, the implementation of NAP will be based on a system of data collection, analysis and dissemination, in close coordination with the National Institute of Statistics. Regarding monitoring and evaluation, the Ministry of Family and Promotion of Women will be assisted by the Ministerial Departments of National Defense and Interior (Deputy Coordinators) and the other Ministerial Departments as social agents in order to ensure a greater intersectoral and interdisciplinary approach to implementing these policies.
The responsibility of coordinating the central and local level are assumed by the Ministerial Department of the Family and Promotion of Women, requiring a strong intersectoral and interdisciplinary link, involving and responsible actors such as:

Civil Society Organisations
Academic and scientific community
Social Media
Communities and families

5,Argentina,5,1,1,,,"Argentina adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015 for the period 2015-2018 and the second NAP in 2022. Analysis on the 2022 NAP is forthcoming. The 2015 NAP was developed by the Ministry of External Relations and Culture in coordination with a number of ministries, including Ministries of Security; Justice and Human Rights; Interior and Transportation; Work, Labor and Social Security; Education; Health; Economy and Public Finances; and Defense. The NAP indicates civil society involvement in the NAP development process, but does not specify further details on which civil society actors were consulted. The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda both domestically and internationally. It aims to increase women'ss participation in politics and include a gender perspective in all matters related to peace and security in the national, regional and international level. While the NAP has a monitoring and evaluation framework, it does not include an allocated budget. Argentina does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but the country was under a military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983, also labeled the ""Dirty War.” In Argentina, women have a long history of peace activism, particularly during the military rule, when Argentine mothers and grandmothers, known as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , brought attention to the crimes of the military regime and demanded the safe return of all the people who were disappeared by the state security forces. In recent years, Argentine feminists have been calling for an end to femicide and sexual and gender-based violence in the country, including the country'ss severe restrictions on sexual and reproductive health and rights. Most recently, feminist activists were pivotal in the legalization of abortion in Argentina in 2020. At the multilateral level, Argentina most recently served as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the period 2013-2014.",1980,30,2014,3.143B,"NAP Development
In 2011, the former Ministry of External Relations and International Trade and Culture initiated a process of dialogue and rapprochement with CSO and women'ss organizations to discuss their proposals for the NAP and to receive their feedback on the designing process of the NAP and the monitoring stage of its implementation.
In 2011, the Ministry of External Relations and International Trade and Culture convened all actors involved in the WPS agenda to participate in an inter-institutional exercise to build a joint vision on peace and security with a gender perspective as captured by the NAP. 
NAP Implementation
We currently do not have a list of civil society organizations that participated in the implementation process with the government. 
The following Ministries are listed as actors in the implementation of Argentina's NAP: Security; Justice and Human Rights; Interior and Transportation; Work, Labor and Social Security; Education; Health; Economy and Public Finances; Defense; and Exterior Relations and Culture. The National Council of Women is also included in the list.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP does not mention any civil society organization or civil society in general as an actor in the monitoring and evaluation process of the NAP's implementation. 
The following government institutions are responsible for monitoring and evaluating the NAP: the National Women Council and the Ministries of the Executive Power.

The implementation period for the Argentinian National Action Plan is three years starting in 2015.",,"Argentina'ss National Action Plan establishes four main goals:
Increase women'ss presence both in peace and humanitarian missions as well as in decision-making positions.
Increase women'ss political participation in peace and security matters, in peace negotiations, in conflict management and in the decision-making spaces for each of these spheres.
Include a gender perspective in all the peacebuilding activities and humanitarian aid missions, including DDR activities.
Protect women and girls's human rights in conflict and post-conflict countries (including refugee camps and displacement), particularly from sexual and gender-based violence, as well as promoting a secure environment.","Each one of the four objectives, includes a list of various actions, as well as the government actors that will take the lead and be responsible for its implementation. The first fundamental goal, ""Increase women'ss presence both in peace and humanitarian missions as well as in their decision-making level”, includes seven actions assigned to the national sphere, i.e. the Argentinian State:
Strengthen the Council on Gender Policies in the Defense Ministry and the specific actors that promote and defend women'ss human rights in the Ministry of Security as part of its role in promoting equality between men and women.
Identify the breakdown of deployed personnel in peace and humanitarian assistance missions according to sex and task developed, and include statistical data on the willingness of female candidates to deploy in peace missions.
Increase female personnel'ss participation in the Army, in the essential staff, and in Military Observers and Liaison Officers roles in peace missions.
Continue to promote the dispersion of information regarding access to the current peace missions and women'ss experiences in peace and humanitarian assistance missions in countries of conflict and post-conflict.
The White Helmet Commission should promote volunteer participation in peace missions, and would consider the inclusion of their personnel in various profiles that could assess the reconstruction processes in conflict and post-conflict countries as well as in situations of emergency and natural disasters.
Promote the egalitarian selection of humanitarian organization with female presence and/or gender perspectives for humanitarian assistance.","The Argentinian NAP includes a final page where the indicators for each objective is listed. For example, in order to fulfil the Objective number 2, ""Increase women'ss political participation in peace and security matters, in peace negotiations, in conflict management and in the decision-making spaces for each of these spheres”, this indicator is established:
The second year of the NAP implementation should have updated data on the number and percentage of women in the executive branch in the public administration.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The monitoring and evaluation indicators in this NAP aim to measure the advances in the implementation of the NAP in the three years period. These indicators have been created based on the indicators proposed by the Secretary General at the United Nations Security Council in response to UNSCR 1889 (2009).
Through the Department called Direccion de la Mujer, the Ministry of External Relations and Culture will convene the National Women Council and the Ministries of the Executive Power: Security; Justice and Human Rights; Interior and Transportation; Work, Labor and Social Security; Education; Health; Economy and Public Finances; and Defense. All of them will create and implement monitoring and evaluation mechanism with an institutional nature, which will guide their actions, enact the pertinent periodic revisions and announce advances in the implementation of the NAP.",,"Argentina'ss National Action Plan does not include an allocated or estimated budget. No indicators or actions are included that formulate fundraising strategies, detail the level of funding required for each specific activity, or accountability mechanisms to ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP. Nonetheless, the NAP states that each participating body is responsible for managing the human and financial resources needed to implement the NAP according to the actions established in it.","One of the main goals of the Argentinian NAP is to ""include a gender perspective in all the peacebuilding activities and humanitarian aid missions, including DDR activities” and, one of the actions established to fulfill this goal is to offer capacity-building to the deployed personnel in peace missions on DDR from a gender perspective. This allows them to identify the specific needs of female ex combatants (women and girls), particularly, in social reintegration processes, women'ss rights and protection from all kinds of violence, and in mechanisms to detect and address gender-based violence and human trafficking victims. Furthermore, in the peace and humanitarian assistance missions, the Punto Focal de Genero (Focal Gender Point) will participate in the execution of DDR operations when mandated by an appropriate body and will apply a gender perspective to these processes.","Ley 23.179 Ratifica la Convencin sobre Eliminacin de todas las Formas de Discriminacin contra la Mujer: Regional Initiatives

",3,Latin America & Caribbean,"Argentina adopted its first National Action Plan NAP in 2015 for the period 2015-2018 and the second NAP in 2022. Analysis on the 2022 NAP is forthcoming. The 2015 NAP was developed by the Ministry of External Relations and Culture in coordination with a number of ministries, including Ministries of Security; Justice and Human Rights; Interior and Transportation; Work, Labor and Social Security; Education; Health; Economy and Public Finances; and Defense. The NAP indicates civil society involvement in the NAP development process, but does not specify further details on which civil society actors were consulted. The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda both domestically and internationally. It aims to increase women'ss participation in politics and include a gender perspective in all matters related to peace and security in the national, regional and international level. While the NAP has a monitoring and evaluation framework, it does not include an allocated budget. Argentina does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but the country was under a military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983, also labeled the ""Dirty War. In Argentina, women have a long history of peace activism, particularly during the military rule, when Argentine mothers and grandmothers, known as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , brought attention to the crimes of the military regime and demanded the safe return of all the people who were disappeared by the state security forces. In recent years, Argentine feminists have been calling for an end to femicide and sexual and gender-based violence in the country, including the country'ss severe restrictions on sexual and reproductive health and rights. Most recently, feminist activists were pivotal in the legalization of abortion in Argentina in 2020. At the multilateral level, Argentina most recently served as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the period 2013-2014. Argentina'ss National Action Plan establishes four main goals: Increase women'ss presence both in peace and humanitarian missions as well as in decision-making positions. Increase women'ss political participation in peace and security matters, in peace negotiations, in conflict management and in the decision-making spaces for each of these spheres. Include a gender perspective in all the peacebuilding activities and humanitarian aid missions, including DDR activities. Protect women and girls's human rights in conflict and post-conflict countries including refugee camps and displacement, particularly from sexual and gender-based violence, as well as promoting a secure environment. Each one of the four objectives, includes a list of various actions, as well as the government actors that will take the lead and be responsible for its implementation. The first fundamental goal, ""Increase women'ss presence both in peace and humanitarian missions as well as in their decision-making level, includes seven actions assigned to the national sphere, i.e. the Argentinian State: Strengthen the Council on Gender Policies in the Defense Ministry and the specific actors that promote and defend women'ss human rights in the Ministry of Security as part of its role in promoting equality between men and women. Identify the breakdown of deployed personnel in peace and humanitarian assistance missions according to sex and task developed, and include statistical data on the willingness of female candidates to deploy in peace missions. Increase female personnel'ss participation in the Army, in the essential staff, and in Military Observers and Liaison Officers roles in peace missions. Continue to promote the dispersion of information regarding access to the current peace missions and women'ss experiences in peace and humanitarian assistance missions in countries of conflict and post-conflict. The White Helmet Commission should promote volunteer participation in peace missions, and would consider the inclusion of their personnel in various profiles that could assess the reconstruction processes in conflict and post-conflict countries as well as in situations of emergency and natural disasters. Promote the egalitarian selection of humanitarian organization with female presence andor gender perspectives for humanitarian assistance. The Argentinian NAP includes a final page where the indicators for each objective is listed. For example, in order to fulfil the Objective number 2, ""Increase women'ss political participation in peace and security matters, in peace negotiations, in conflict management and in the decision-making spaces for each of these spheres, this indicator is established: The second year of the NAP implementation should have updated data on the number and percentage of women in the executive branch in the public administration. Monitoring and Evaluation The monitoring and evaluation indicators in this NAP aim to measure the advances in the implementation of the NAP in the three years period. These indicators have been created based on the indicators proposed by the Secretary General at the United Nations Security Council in response to UNSCR 1889 2009. Through the Department called Direccion de la Mujer, the Ministry of External Relations and Culture will convene the National Women Council and the Ministries of the Executive Power: Security; Justice and Human Rights; Interior and Transportation; Work, Labor and Social Security; Education; Health; Economy and Public Finances; and Defense. All of them will create and implement monitoring and evaluation mechanism with an institutional nature, which will guide their actions, enact the pertinent periodic revisions and announce advances in the implementation of the NAP. Argentina'ss National Action Plan does not include an allocated or estimated budget. No indicators or actions are included that formulate fundraising strategies, detail the level of funding required for each specific activity, or accountability mechanisms to ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP. Nonetheless, the NAP states that each participating body is responsible for managing the human and financial resources needed to implement the NAP according to the actions established in it. One of the main goals of the Argentinian NAP is to ""include a gender perspective in all the peacebuilding activities and humanitarian aid missions, including DDR activities and, one of the actions established to fulfill this goal is to offer capacity-building to the deployed personnel in peace missions on DDR from a gender perspective. This allows them to identify the specific needs of female ex combatants women and girls, particularly, in social reintegration processes, women'ss rights and protection from all kinds of violence, and in mechanisms to detect and address gender-based violence and human trafficking victims. Furthermore, in the peace and humanitarian assistance missions, the Punto Focal de Genero Focal Gender Point will participate in the execution of DDR operations when mandated by an appropriate body and will apply a gender perspective to these processes."
6,Armenia,5,1,1,61.8,24.2,"Armenia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2021 and its most recent for the period 2022-2024. Analysis is forthcoming. The 2019-2021 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it does not indicate civil society inclusion in the development of the NAP. Armenia'ss NAP focuses heavily on increasing women'ss participation in and awareness of the protection of women'ss rights within the defense system (military, police, and peacekeeping missions). The NAP also puts particular emphasis on creating comprehensive programs to address the needs of women and girls impacted by or displaced as a result of conflicts. The NAP includes components on the international implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda, especially in light of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, the document specifically states that Armenia considers the NAP ""as a national mechanism for the protection and promotion of women'ss rights in public life” (p. 2). The NAP identifies 18 objectives that are grouped under the primary pillars of Resolution 1325: participation; protection; prevention; and relief and recovery. While each objective has corresponding actions, indicators, and responsible parties, there is no allocated funding. Armenia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The country has been in an ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan since 1988 as a result of the long-standing dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The conflict has resulted in thousands of casualties as well as refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs). Even though a ceasefire was put into effect in 1994, there has been ongoing tension between the two countries. The conflict erupted again most recently in 2022. The conflict has had distinct gendered impacts , affecting women'ss lives in the public and private realm alike. Women'ss organizations have been at the forefront to demand an end to hostilities and establish peace. Despite their on-the-ground efforts, women have been excluded from high-level diplomatic negotiations.",1993,98,,673M,"The analysis in these tabs corresponds to the 2019-2021 NAP.
NAP Development:
The NAP was developed by Armenia'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
The NAP does not indicate civil society inclusion in the development of the NAP. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Armenia and therefore was not involved in the development process of Armenia'ss NAP.
NAP Implementation:
The NAP lists non-governmental organizations as a ""co-executor” of 10 out of the 18 objectives listed. Additionally, objectives #2 and #7 listed under participation directly outlines a goal to ""promote cooperation between governmental bodies, women'ss organizations, and women affected by conflicts” (p.2, implementation matrix) and ""collaboration with national institutions, local self-governing bodies, non-governmental organizations” (p. 4, implementation matrix), respectively. Despite this emphasis on civil society on both objective, non-governmental organizations are not listed as a ""co-executor” on the implementation matrix of either objective.  
The NAP indicates that an Interagency Commission, composed of representatives from 12 ministries and government organizations will be responsible for implementing the NAP. These government actors are: Prime Minister'ss Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Ministry of Economic Development and Investments, Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ministry of Territorial Administration and Development, Police of the Republic of Armenia, National Institute of Education of the Ministry of Education and Science, State Migration Service of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Development, and Armeanian Red Cross Society. 
NAP Monitoring & Evaluation:
The NAP indicates that a working group that consists of three ministries (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) and three non-governmental organizations with ""sufficient expertise and knowledge on issues related to Women, Peace and Security” (p. 10) will be established a year prior to the implementation of the NAP for monitoring and evaluation purposes. However, the NAP does not clearly indicate which NGOs will be a part of the working group.
The NAP indicates that a working group that consists of three ministries (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) and three non-governmental organizations will be established a year prior to the implementation of the NAP for monitoring and evaluation purposes.",The implementation period of the NAP is two years (2019-2021).,"The NAP identifies 18 objectives, compiled under the four pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation, protection, prevention, and relief and recovery. On Armenia'ss NAP, participation has seven objectives, protection has five objectives, prevention has four objectives, and relief and recovery has two objectives listed. For example, objective #2 listed under participation is: ""Promote cooperation between governmental bodies, women'ss organisations and women affected by conflicts, in the fields of conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding.” (p. 2, implementation matrix).  ","The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that breaks down each objective with corresponding measures, time limit, performance indicators, responsible executor, co-executor, and funding source. For example, objective #2 listed under participation identifies ""organization of state-supported awareness raising campaigns and programmes for women'ss organisations and women affected by conflicts on such issues as conflict prevention, confidence building measures, peacebuilding, as well as the challenges and risks related to them” as an activity (p. 2, implementation matrix). ","The NAP identifies several performance indicators for each objective, outlined on the implementation matrix. For example, objective #2 listed under participation identifies ""ensuring more targeted activities within 1325 gender thematic group, including availability of seminars for women affected by conflicts” as a performance indicator (p. 2, implementation matrix).","The NAP indicates that a working group that consists of three ministries (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) and three non-governmental organizations will be established a year prior to the implementation of the NAP for monitoring and evaluation purposes. The group will assess the work being conducted and offer needed recommendations on an annual basis. The NAP does not provide further specifics on monitoring and evaluation.","The NAP does not contain an allocated or estimated budget. Even though there is a ""funding source” field for each objective, the field identifies ""other sources not prohibited by law” for the funding source of each objective."," Even though Armenia has been in an ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh since 1988, the country'ss NAP does not mention disarmament or demilitarization.","16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence Campaign: Prevention > Awareness-raising Campaigns

",4,Eastern Europe & Central Asia,"Armenia adopted its first National Action Plan NAP in 2019 for the period 2019-2021 and its most recent for the period 2022-2024. Analysis is forthcoming. The 2019-2021 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it does not indicate civil society inclusion in the development of the NAP. Armenia'ss NAP focuses heavily on increasing women'ss participation in and awareness of the protection of women'ss rights within the defense system military, police, and peacekeeping missions. The NAP also puts particular emphasis on creating comprehensive programs to address the needs of women and girls impacted by or displaced as a result of conflicts. The NAP includes components on the international implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security WPS agenda, especially in light of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, the document specifically states that Armenia considers the NAP ""as a national mechanism for the protection and promotion of women'ss rights in public life p. 2. The NAP identifies 18 objectives that are grouped under the primary pillars of Resolution 1325: participation; protection; prevention; and relief and recovery. While each objective has corresponding actions, indicators, and responsible parties, there is no allocated funding. Armenia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The country has been in an ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan since 1988 as a result of the long-standing dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The conflict has resulted in thousands of casualties as well as refugees and internally displaced people IDPs. Even though a ceasefire was put into effect in 1994, there has been ongoing tension between the two countries. The conflict erupted again most recently in 2022. The conflict has had distinct gendered impacts , affecting women'ss lives in the public and private realm alike. Women'ss organizations have been at the forefront to demand an end to hostilities and establish peace. Despite their on-the-ground efforts, women have been excluded from high-level diplomatic negotiations. The NAP identifies 18 objectives, compiled under the four pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation, protection, prevention, and relief and recovery. On Armenia'ss NAP, participation has seven objectives, protection has five objectives, prevention has four objectives, and relief and recovery has two objectives listed. For example, objective 2 listed under participation is: ""Promote cooperation between governmental bodies, women'ss organisations and women affected by conflicts, in the fields of conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding. p. 2, implementation matrix. The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that breaks down each objective with corresponding measures, time limit, performance indicators, responsible executor, co-executor, and funding source. For example, objective 2 listed under participation identifies ""organization of state-supported awareness raising campaigns and programmes for women'ss organisations and women affected by conflicts on such issues as conflict prevention, confidence building measures, peacebuilding, as well as the challenges and risks related to them as an activity p. 2, implementation matrix. The NAP identifies several performance indicators for each objective, outlined on the implementation matrix. For example, objective 2 listed under participation identifies ""ensuring more targeted activities within 1325 gender thematic group, including availability of seminars for women affected by conflicts as a performance indicator p. 2, implementation matrix. The NAP indicates that a working group that consists of three ministries Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and three non-governmental organizations will be established a year prior to the implementation of the NAP for monitoring and evaluation purposes. The group will assess the work being conducted and offer needed recommendations on an annual basis. The NAP does not provide further specifics on monitoring and evaluation. The NAP does not contain an allocated or estimated budget. Even though there is a ""funding source field for each objective, the field identifies ""other sources not prohibited by law for the funding source of each objective. Even though Armenia has been in an ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh since 1988, the country'ss NAP does not mention disarmament or demilitarization."
7,Australia,3,1,1,,29.9,"Australia has adopted a second National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2021-2031 . The development of Australia'ss second National Action Plan comes at the behest of a changing global context, where new challenges including climate change and health pandemics contribute to fragility and conflict (p.6). The Australian Government developed their National Action Plan with recommendations from two independent reviews, national consultations conducted by government and civil society, and women, peace, and security research and evidence (p.11). It will be implemented by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Defense, Department of Home Affairs, Australia'ss Federal Police, and the Australian Civil-Military Centre. Australia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2012, for the period 2012-2018. The NAP was developed by the Australian Government Office for Women, which was tasked with convening the Women, Peace and Security Inter-Departmental Working Group. The government undertook extensive civil society engagement leading up to and during the development of the NAP, including with WILPF Australia. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda mostly internationally. Australia does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a contributor to UN peacekeeping operations and NATO military missions and provides international humanitarian relief and development assistance. This includes peacekeeping missions in East Timor, regional assistance missions in the Solomon Islands, and humanitarian support and law enforcement to indigenous communities. Australia is a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Australia is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Australia was UN Women 'ss ninth largest other resources and regular resources contributor with USD $8.8 million and USD $5.5 million, respectively. At the multilateral level, Australia most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2013-2014.",1983,44,2014,25.912B,"NAP Development 
The development of Australia'ss second National Action Plan comes at the behest of a changing global context, where new challenges including violent extremism, climate, and health pandemics contribute to fragility and conflict (p.6). The Australian Government developed their National Action Plan with recommendations from two independent reviews, national consultations conducted by government and civil society, and women, peace, and security research and evidence (p.11). While civil society groups and organisations are not named explicitly as groups consulted in the development of the nation'ss second NAP, the NAP does aim to strengthen partnerships with civil society and support their capacity building. In a commitment to work in partnership with civil society, the Australian government seeks to collaborate across ""two key functions - advice and accountability” (p.55). 
NAP Implementation
The implementation of Australia'ss National Action Plan is underpinned by the following four principles: a ‘do no harm's approach, a human rights-based approach, gender mainstreaming, and recognising and responding to diverse experiences. The NAP declares women and girls participation to be at the centre of Australia'ss efforts on implementation (p.8). The implementation plan will be delivered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Defense, Department of Home Affairs, Australia'ss Federal Police, and the Australian Civil-Military Centre. These Departments will strengthen implementation by increasing women'ss participation and leadership in the peace and security sector, building knowledge and capabilities, using evidence-based approaches, and strengthening their partnership with civil society (p. 10). Each implementing department and agency will develop and release its own implementation plan that will outline department and agency activities that contribute to National Action Plan outcomes. Implementation plans usually have a two-year duration (p.52). 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation 
The NAP applies a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework that will support ongoing improvements to implementation to ensure progress towards outcomes, through progress reporting and independent review. Regular progress reporting will draw on qualitative evidence (including case studies) to demonstrate the impact of their initiative. Outcome data will be disaggregated at the country level where Australian implementation is focused (p. 58). Departments's implementation plans will also identify actions that contribute to National Action Plan outcomes and medium term outcomes (p. 56). There will be regular progress reporting and quantitative indicators selected from available data sets for their ability to measure progress overtime. The Australian government recognises that new indicators and data sources may emerge as global gender data matures (p. 58). ","The Australia NAP covers a ten year period from 2021 to 2031. The Independent Interim review will be commissioned in July 2025 with the goal of completion in December 2025. The review will consider the effectiveness of actions in meeting the NAP'ss medium-term outcomes, It will recommend ways to improve ongoing implementation and set targets for the end of this NAP (p.57). 
The Independent Final Review will assess the National Action Plan'ss effectiveness over its lifetime. It will also consider changes relevant to the design of Australia'ss third National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security. It will be commissioned by July 2030 with an aim to be completed by December 2030 (p.57). ","The Australia NAP is organised into four Key Outcomes designed to guide the nation'ss international efforts in fragile and conflict-affected contexts. 
The first key outcome to support women'ss meaningful participation and needs in peace processes will require increasing women'ss participation in conflict prevention and in all peace processes (p. 10). 
The second key outcome to reduce sexual and gender based violence will require reducing harmful gender norms, increasing women and girl'ss safety and security, and increasing access to justice (p.10). 
The third key outcome, supporting the resilient, crisis, and security, law and justice efforts to meet the needs of all women and girls, will require security, law, and justice responses, preventing and countering violent extremism, and humanitarian action, stabilisation and disaster management (p.10).
The final key outcome, demonstrating leadership and accountability for WPS, requires Australia'ss demonstration of global leadership and accountability. These key outcomes are designed to reflect UNSCR 1325 and related resolutions (p.10). ","Each Outcome of the Australia NAP includes actions for practically achieving these goals followed by a case study demonstrating the validity of such actions. These key outcomes are categorized by thematic areas of the WPS agenda. 
For example, Key Outcome 1 calls for supporting women and girls's meaningful participation and needs in conflict prevention and peace processes. This outcome is in alignment with the participation pillar of the WPS agenda. Meeting this commitment means (p.20): 
Connecting informal decision-making to formal decision-making in peace processes 
Redesigning peace negotiations to ensure women have a seat at the table 
Amplifying the efforts of civil society coalitions, women'ss rights organisations and women'ss human rights defenders, and 
Supporting women'ss capacities to analyse, shape agendas, organize and exercise their voice and agency, and their political involvement - and recognising that sometimes they participate differently. 
Australia'ss actions aim to (p. 21): 
ensure women and their representative organisations are included in political dialogues and development programming on conflict prevention 
ensure gender indicators are included in conflict early warning systems to better monitor and respond to women and girls's experiences of insecurity 
support existing community mobilisation — including the efforts of civil society coalitions, women'ss rights organisations and youth organisations and human rights defenders — to realise gender equality, remove existing barriers to decision-making structures, and address gendered barriers to social, economic and political rights 
conduct gender-sensitive conflict analysis that includes analysis of the drivers for conflict prevention and peace, and 
support existing efforts to challenge discriminatory gender norms, including about unpaid care, access to education, health and other services, and economic participation, that limit women and girls's roles.  
Australia'ss Actions Aim to (p.24): 
support women'ss rights organisations to engage, participate and influence inclusive peace processes at all levels 
provide care services, and financial, transport and accommodation support to enable women to participate in peace and security processes as they occur • support capacity building to ensure men and women, including in negotiation and mediation teams, can design gender equality provisions 
support capacity building to ensure men and women can implement the gender equality provisions of peace agreements • influence government agencies involved in the peace process to incorporate women'ss issues and provide access for women in negotiations or discussions 
use Australia'ss diplomatic leadership to advocate, including for women and girls's participation in peace processes, reconciliation and stabilisation efforts, and • ensure women and girls can access education and economic opportunities.","The Australia NAP lists measures associated with each key outcome in its monitoring and evaluation from work and identifies the organization collecting that data. 
Example taken from Key Outcome 3: Supporting resilience, crisis response, and security, law and justice sector efforts to meet the needs and rights of all women and girls (p.61): 
Outcome Indicators (p. 61) 
Number and percentage of countries that have laws and regulations that restrict women'ss ability to participate in society and the economy relative to men; data collected by UN Women, World Bank, OECD, ILO 
Maternal mortality ratio; data collected by UNODC and WHO 
Increasing Access to security, law, and justice responses indicators 
Number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population; data collection by UNODC and WHO 
Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported to competent authorities or other officially recognised conflict resolution mechanisms; data collected by UNDODC 
Humanitarian action, stabilisation and disaster management Indicators 
Number of women and men, girls and boys, provided with lifesaving assistance in crisis situations; data collected by Australian Government 
Percentage of women and men, girls and boys affected who report they are satisfied with the opportunities they had to influence the response; data collected by Australian government. ","Progress reporting will track the Australian Government'ss contributions to the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and will be delivered regularly over the course of the National Action Plan (p.57). Progress reports will capture departments's implementation actions and the monitoring and evaluation framework will form the basis of progress resorting. 
Two independent reviews will be commissioned over the course of the National Action Plan. Recommendations from the independent reviews will be considered by the Australian Government and inform ongoing implementation. ",The Australia NAP does not include an allocated or estimated budget and there are no other financial resource consideration references within the NAP.,"The Australia National Action Plan does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity.","Australian Capital Territory Crimes Act: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

",2,East Asia & Pacific,"Australia has adopted a second National Action Plan NAP for the period 2021-2031 . The development of Australia'ss second National Action Plan comes at the behest of a changing global context, where new challenges including climate change and health pandemics contribute to fragility and conflict p.6. The Australian Government developed their National Action Plan with recommendations from two independent reviews, national consultations conducted by government and civil society, and women, peace, and security research and evidence p.11. It will be implemented by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Defense, Department of Home Affairs, Australia'ss Federal Police, and the Australian Civil-Military Centre. Australia adopted its first National Action Plan NAP in 2012, for the period 2012-2018. The NAP was developed by the Australian Government Office for Women, which was tasked with convening the Women, Peace and Security Inter-Departmental Working Group. The government undertook extensive civil society engagement leading up to and during the development of the NAP, including with WILPF Australia. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security WPS agenda mostly internationally. Australia does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a contributor to UN peacekeeping operations and NATO military missions and provides international humanitarian relief and development assistance. This includes peacekeeping missions in East Timor, regional assistance missions in the Solomon Islands, and humanitarian support and law enforcement to indigenous communities.

In 2019, Australia was UN Women 'ss ninth largest other resources and regular resources contributor with USD 8.8 million and USD 5.5 million, respectively. At the multilateral level, Australia most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2013-2014. The Australia NAP is organised into four Key Outcomes designed to guide the nation'ss international efforts in fragile and conflict-affected contexts. The first key outcome to support women'ss meaningful participation and needs in peace processes will require increasing women'ss participation in conflict prevention and in all peace processes p. 10. The second key outcome to reduce sexual and gender based violence will require reducing harmful gender norms, increasing women and girl'ss safety and security, and increasing access to justice p.10. The third key outcome, supporting the resilient, crisis, and security, law and justice efforts to meet the needs of all women and girls, will require security, law, and justice responses, preventing and countering violent extremism, and humanitarian action, stabilisation and disaster management p.10. The final key outcome, demonstrating leadership and accountability for WPS, requires Australia'ss demonstration of global leadership and accountability. These key outcomes are designed to reflect UNSCR 1325 and related resolutions p.10. Each Outcome of the Australia NAP includes actions for practically achieving these goals followed by a case study demonstrating the validity of such actions.

The Australia NAP lists measures associated with each key outcome in its monitoring and evaluation from work and identifies the organization collecting that data. Example taken from Key Outcome 3: Supporting resilience, crisis response, and security, law and justice sector efforts to meet the needs and rights of all women and girls p.61: Outcome Indicators p. 61 Number and percentage of countries that have laws and regulations that restrict women'ss ability to participate in society and the economy relative to men; data collected by UN Women, World Bank, OECD, ILO Maternal mortality ratio; data collected by UNODC and WHO Increasing Access to security, law, and justice responses indicators Number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population; data collection by UNODC and WHO Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported to competent authorities or other officially recognised conflict resolution mechanisms; data collected by UNDODC Humanitarian action, stabilisation and disaster management Indicators Number of women and men, girls and boys, provided with lifesaving assistance in crisis situations; data collected by Australian Government Percentage of women and men, girls and boys affected who report they are satisfied with the opportunities they had to influence the response; data collected by Australian government. Progress reporting will track the Australian Government'ss contributions to the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and will be delivered regularly over the course of the National Action Plan p.57. Progress reports will capture departments's implementation actions and the monitoring and evaluation framework will form the basis of progress resorting. Two independent reviews will be commissioned over the course of the National Action Plan. Recommendations from the independent reviews will be considered by the Australian Government and inform ongoing implementation. The Australia NAP does not include an allocated or estimated budget and there are no other financial resource consideration references within the NAP. The Australia National Action Plan does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity."
8,Austria,4,1,1,,,"Austria adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2012, but the NAP does not identify a specific period of implementation. The NAP was developed by an inter-ministerial group, which consisted of the Federal Ministries of European and International Affairs; Interior; Justice; Defence; Sports; along with the Federal Chancellery and the Austrian Development Agency. The NAP indicates civil society involvement in the NAP development, implementation, and monitoring process. Austria'ss NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and outlines three main objectives towards the implementation of UNSCR 1325. These include increasing the representation of women in international peace operations; strengthening the participation of women in peace initiatives and high-level decision-making spaces; and preventing gender-based violence and protecting the rights of women in humanitarian settings. The NAP outlines a monitoring and evaluation framework that consists of annual reviews and comprehensive reporting requirements. Austria'ss NAP does not include an allocated budget, but indicates that the activities identified in the NAP ""will be ensured by the responsible ministries within the funds available in their respective budgets.” Austria'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2007, without a specific period of implementation. The NAP was developed through the cooperation of several ministries following consultations with civil society members. Austria'ss first and second NAPs are similar in length and level of detail, approaching the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda in a mostly international way. As such, the NAPs identify increasing women'ss representation in peacekeeping operations; lobbying for the implementation of Resolution 1325 at the multilateral level; and supporting gender-based reforms in conflict-affected countries among some of its objectives. The second NAP does not provide an overview of the findings from the implementation of the first NAP, nor does it have a lessons learned section. The first NAP identifies working with civil society on conflict prevention and peacebuilding as a priority area for international cooperation. While civil society still has a role in the second NAP, its incorporation appears to focus more on ""engagement” and capacity building instead of being framed as a cooperation. Austria reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates: Within the scope of the NAP, measures are taken to promote the participation of women in peace processes, to strengthen preventive measures against violence against women, to increase the proportion of women participating in peacekeeping operations and to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions in international organisations like the UN or the EU. (p. 18) A working group led by the Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs, reviews the implementation of the NAP once a year. (pp. 61-62) The most recent, ninth implementation report offers an overview of the level of implementation of the revised NAP and the measures taken to support women in conflict and post-conflict situations in 2017. (pp. 61-62) The Austrian Development Agency passed a gender guideline which also aims to implement the NAP 1325. In addition to that, the Austrian Development Agency supports a number of initiatives in the field women, peace, security. (pp. 61-62) Austria does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military and peacekeeping operations. Austria is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. At the multilateral level, Austria most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2009-2010 and is currently a candidate for a non-permanent member position for the period 2027-2028.",1982,,2014,4.8B,"NAP Development
Ten civil society organizations and three specific organizations (CARE Austria, University of Vienna – Department of International Relations, and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights) were consulted prior to the development of the first NAP, and although it was mandated in the NAP, Civil Society was not provided opportunity to have input into the review that informed the current revised NAP.
WILPF does not have a country section in Austria and therefore was not involved in the development process of Austria'ss NAP.
The development of the NAP was led by the Austrian Inter-ministerial group, that includes the participation of the FCH, the Federal Chancellery, Directariate General II, FMEIA Federal Ministry of European and International Affairs , FMoI Federal Ministry of the Interior, FMoJ Federal Ministry of Justice, FMoDS Federal Ministry of Defense and Sports, and ADA Austrian Development Agency.
NAP Implementation
Civil society has an ongoing specified role in providing input on specific cases and to annual reporting. The first and revised NAP articulate that the Inter-ministerial Working Group must hold at least one meeting with Civil Society each year. However Civil Society implementation reviews have noted that although the Inter-ministerial Working Group has been accessible to Civil Society on an ad hoc basis, the requirement to schedule formal meetings had not been met. Further, although required in the NAP, implementation reviews for the first NAP were conducted without Civil Society consultation.
The Inter-ministerial working group of Austria will continue to operate as the primary Austrian Government mechanism responsible for Austria'ss implementation of the UNSCR 1325 and UNSCR 1820. In addition, the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women which became operational as of 1 January 2011, has been playing a role in Austria'ss process and protocol regarding UNSCR 1325.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil Society also has a role outside the limited formal mechanisms specified in the NAP, particularly through oversight, promoting UNSCR 1325, education and training, as well as cooperation and support with international organizations and women at the grass roots level. Civil Society in Austria has lacked coordination, and in recognizing this in 2008, CARE Austria initiated the informal Group of Friends of UN SCR 1325, which has met on a semi-regular basis with government ministries and civil society groups. 
While an annual meeting takes place, Austria pays close attention to the application of the UN Indicators for monitoring the implementation of UNSCR 1325. Furthermore, while the meeting is held annually, additional meetings and conferences take place, lastly appropriate measures are taken to include civil society, and raise awareness.","The Austrian NAP does not specify timeframes set for Actions. However, many activities are identified as an ""ongoing” and to be reviewed in an annual report. (seen throughout Austria'ss NAP).","The Revised Austrian National Action Plan contains the same three objectives:
Strategic Objective 1: Increase the representation of women as well as enhanced consideration of the objectives defined in Resolution 1325 in training activities for international peace operations.
Strategic Objective 2: Strengthen the participation of women in peace promoting and conflict resolving activities, especially by promoting local peace initiatives by women and increasing the share of women in decision-making positions in international and European organization.
Strategic Objective 3: Prevent gender-specific violence and protecting the needs of women and girls within the scope of peace missions, humanitarian operations and in camps for refugees and internally displaced persons.","The Austrian National Action Plan is organized by national, international/regional and bilateral, and development cooperation activities, which can be found in detail in the NAP.
Strategic Objective 2 of the Austrian NAP includes a series of actions for practically achieving these goals.
Strategic Objective 2: Participation, ""Promoting political participation of women. Strengthening the representation of women through capacity-building” contains the following actions:
Strategies and measures taken to increase the share of women in the overall number of Austrian participants in the UN and EU peace operations and OSCE missions.
Deployment of gender experts, gender advisors, junior officer professionals and other experts.
Balanced nominations of male and female Austrians to EU and OSCE election monitoring missions.
Increased nominations of female Austrians to leadership positions in EU, UN and all OSCE dimensions.","The Austrian NAP lists measures associated with each strategic objective in its monitoring and evaluation framework. These range from measurable and specific to general and are principally qualitative in nature.
For example, in Strategic Objective 3: ""Provision of technical support to security sector reform and monitoring activities"": 
Support for measures aimed at strengthening protection, security and human rights, and the total amount of financial support provided.","Inter-ministerial Working Group, which is led by the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs and comprised of representatives of all relevant ministries and the Austrian Development Agency.
The working group is required to provide annual progress reports to the Austrian Council of Ministers, which is then forwarded to Parliament. Civil society is required to have input in the review process, facilitated primarily through annual joint meetings, and the provision of ad hoc civil society representation to the working group. Civil Society input must be sought in advance of preparing annual reports. As noted, this did not occur during the life of the first NAP.
Coordination, Monitoring and Reporting is a priority within the ""Activities in Austria” strategic area of the NAP. As such, specific activities, indicators, timelines and responsible actors are articulated.
Annual reports must be forwarded to the Parliament and made publicly available through departmental websites.
A comprehensive review of the NAP, in cooperation with Civil Society, is scheduled for 2016.","The Austrian NAP does not include an allocated or estimated budget, and instead states that ""Financing of the activities resulting from the implementation of the Action Plan will be ensured by the responsible ministries within the funds available in their respective budgets.”
The initial NAP and its revision did not include indicators or actions to formulate strategies for sourcing increased funding, level of funding required for specific activities, or accountability mechanisms to ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP.

12,Bangladesh,23,1,1,63.8,,"Bangladesh adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2019-2022. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through a participatory approach that included civil society organizations as well as divisional and district-level consultations with grassroots women'ss organizations. Bangladesh'ss NAP builds on the country'ss prior gender legislation and action plans, including those on preventing violence against women and children; human trafficking; development; and disaster policy. In line with this background, the NAP provides an overview of Bangladesh'ss WPS-related legal and political actions as well as a detailed discussion of women'ss experiences and needs related to the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda, addressed extensively as part of the NAP development process. The NAP identifies nine overall objectives grouped under three thematic clusters that focus on prevention; participation; and protection, relief, and recovery. The NAP indicates that the remnants of Bangladesh'ss Liberation War and the wartime sexual violence endured by women had an impact on the content of the action plan, especially with regards to the rehabilitation of women victims. Additionally, one of the key objectives of the NAP highlights root cause analysis and gender-responsive conflict monitoring as key to conflict prevention. While the NAP has a detailed implementation matrix, it does not include an allocated budget. Bangladesh gained independence in 1971 following the Indo-Pakistani War, also known as the Bangladesh Liberation War. The conflict resulted in thousands of casualties, with sexual violence used as a weapon of war through the mass rape of Bangladeshi women. In 2010, Bangladesh'ss Awami League (AL) government established the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), a domestic court charged with investigating the genocide and war crimes that occurred during the 1971 war. However, the court is yet to fully address wartime sexual and gender-based violence. More recently, in 1997, Bangladesh signed the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord in order to end the long-lasting ethnic conflict between the Bangladeshi government and its indigenous populations. Since 2017, Bangladesh has also been grappling with the spillover effects of Myanmar'ss ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya people, and currently hosts over 700,000 Rohingya refugees, most of whom are women and girls. Women'ss rights activists in Bangladesh have been working to reduce violence against women, including acid attacks , which is among the primary forms of gender-based violence in the country. At the multilateral level, Bangladesh most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2000-2001, during which it played a key role in the adoption of Resolution 1325, the landmark resolution of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda.",1984,50,,4.358B,"NAP Development
The NAP was developed through a participatory approach that incorporated civil society organizations into the NAP'ss development through multiple consultations, a national seminar, and a validation workshop conducted prior to the NAP'ss approval. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Bangladesh and therefore was not involved in the development process of its NAP.
The NAP was developed through a participatory approach that included governmental and non-governmental organizations. The meetings of the NAP Coordination Group were overseen by Bangladesh'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
NAP Implementation
An inter-ministerial Coordination Group, which includes two civil society representatives, will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the NAP. Additionally, the NAP indicates that Bangladesh'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs ""will coordinate to mobilize civil society organizations working in relevant programmatic sectors to support the implementing agencies, to deliver results and create greater impact” (p. 12). 
An inter-ministerial Coordination Group will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the NAP. Additionally, individual ministries are tasked with implementing specific activities identified in the action plan.   
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
An inter-ministerial Coordination Group, which includes two civil society representatives, will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the NAP. Additionally, the NAP indicates that a Consultative Platform of civil society organizations will be established to enable civil society inclusion in the monitoring, reporting, and evaluation process of the action plan.
An inter-ministerial Coordination Group will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the NAP. Bangladesh'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs will oversee the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation team.   ",The implementation period of the NAP is three years (2019-2022).,"The NAP identifies three pillars through which to implement the action plan: 1) prevention, 2) participation, and 3) protection, relief, and recovery. The overall objectives of these pillars are as follows:
Prevention: To engage more communities and institutions in initiatives to promote social cohesion and prevent conflict, violent extremism, and gender discrimination. 
Participation: To increase women'ss meaningful participation in maintaining peace and security, including peacebuilding and conflict resolution processes, peacekeeping missions, disaster management and response, humanitarian assistance, and the prevention of violent extremism. 
Protection, relief, and recovery: To protect women'ss safety and well-being and to ensure that their needs, priorities and rights are addressed in the emergency situations of natural disasters and humanitarian crises.","The NAP'ss three main pillars each have an overall objective, which are then broken down into sub-objectives (referred to as ""outputs”). While the first and second pillars (prevention and participation) each have one output, the third pillar (protection, relief, and recovery) has three outputs. For example, the pillar on ""prevention,” lists ""key government institutions have increased their awareness and knowledge of the root causes of conflict and violent extremism and how to address them, including an understanding of the role women play in preventing conflict and violent extremism” as an output (p. 14). This output is then broken down into specific activities, one of which is as follows: ""Commission research on the root causes of conflict and violent extremism in Bangladesh and their effect on women, including a mapping of existing research on gender and violent extremism and the roles women play in preventing violent extremism” (p. 14). ","The NAP identifies several indicators for each objective, outlined in the implementation matrix. For example, the outcome for the overall objective of the prevention pillar lists ""Number of research initiatives conducted on the root causes of conflict and violent extremism, the role of women, and their effect on women” as an indicator.","The annual progress of the NAP'ss implementation will be jointly monitored by the Coordination Group and the Consultative Platform through a multi-tier monitoring plan. The Coordination Group will develop a ""standard, results-based reporting template” (p. 13) to monitor the NAP. Based on the indicators identified in the monitoring framework, sex and age-disaggregated data will be collected. Each ministry and department or division represented on the Coordination Group will appoint a contact person to lead internal monitoring and reporting. Additionally, Bangladesh'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs will oversee the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation team. Relevant ministries and departments or divisions will submit annual progress reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The monitoring and evaluation team will then consolidate these reports and present them to the Coordination Group and the Consultative Platform for review and feedback. Finally, a thorough review of the overall NAP implementation will be conducted at the end of three years, and the NAP may be revised for a further period upon consultations with stakeholders.","The NAP indicates that the action plan ""will be funded primarily by the state budgeting mechanism” and that each responsible ministry will incorporate WPS actions into their individual budget, which is already gender-responsive. Additionally, the NAP states that ""additional resources from prospective international and multinational development partners will be sought” (p. 12). However, the NAP does not include an overall allocated or estimated budget.",The NAP does not address disarmament or demilitarization.,"Ministry of Women and Children Affairs: Institutional mechanisms

",3,South Asia,"Bangladesh adopted its first National Action Plan NAP for the period 2019-2022. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through a participatory approach that included civil society organizations as well as divisional and district-level consultations with grassroots women'ss organizations. Bangladesh'ss NAP builds on the country'ss prior gender legislation and action plans, including those on preventing violence against women and children; human trafficking; development; and disaster policy. In line with this background, the NAP provides an overview of Bangladesh'ss WPS-related legal and political actions as well as a detailed discussion of women'ss experiences and needs related to the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda, addressed extensively as part of the NAP development process. The NAP identifies nine overall objectives grouped under three thematic clusters that focus on prevention; participation; and protection, relief, and recovery. The NAP indicates that the remnants of Bangladesh'ss Liberation War and the wartime sexual violence endured by women had an impact on the content of the action plan, especially with regards to the rehabilitation of women victims. Additionally, one of the key objectives of the NAP highlights root cause analysis and gender-responsive conflict monitoring as key to conflict prevention. While the NAP has a detailed implementation matrix, it does not include an allocated budget. Bangladesh gained independence in 1971 following the Indo-Pakistani War, also known as the Bangladesh Liberation War. The conflict resulted in thousands of casualties, with sexual violence used as a weapon of war through the mass rape of Bangladeshi women. In 2010, Bangladesh'ss Awami League AL government established the International Crimes Tribunal ICT, a domestic court charged with investigating the genocide and war crimes that occurred during the 1971 war. However, the court is yet to fully address wartime sexual and gender-based violence. More recently, in 1997, Bangladesh signed the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord in order to end the long-lasting ethnic conflict between the Bangladeshi government and its indigenous populations. Since 2017, Bangladesh has also been grappling with the spillover effects of Myanmar'ss ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya people, and currently hosts over 700,000 Rohingya refugees, most of whom are women and girls. Women'ss rights activists in Bangladesh have been working to reduce violence against women, including acid attacks , which is among the primary forms of gender-based violence in the country. At the multilateral level, Bangladesh most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2000-2001, during which it played a key role in the adoption of Resolution 1325, the landmark resolution of the Women, Peace, and Security WPS agenda. The NAP identifies three pillars through which to implement the action plan: 1 prevention, 2 participation, and 3 protection, relief, and recovery. The overall objectives of these pillars are as follows: Prevention: To engage more communities and institutions in initiatives to promote social cohesion and prevent conflict, violent extremism, and gender discrimination. Participation: To increase women'ss meaningful participation in maintaining peace and security, including peacebuilding and conflict resolution processes, peacekeeping missions, disaster management and response, humanitarian assistance, and the prevention of violent extremism. Protection, relief, and recovery: To protect women'ss safety and well-being and to ensure that their needs, priorities and rights are addressed in the emergency situations of natural disasters and humanitarian crises. The NAP'ss three main pillars each have an overall objective, which are then broken down into sub-objectives referred to as ""outputs. While the first and second pillars prevention and participation each have one output, the third pillar protection, relief, and recovery has three outputs. For example, the pillar on ""prevention, lists ""key government institutions have increased their awareness and knowledge of the root causes of conflict and violent extremism and how to address them, including an understanding of the role women play in preventing conflict and violent extremism as an output p. 14. This output is then broken down into specific activities, one of which is as follows: ""Commission research on the root causes of conflict and violent extremism in Bangladesh and their effect on women, including a mapping of existing research on gender and violent extremism and the roles women play in preventing violent extremism p. 14. The NAP identifies several indicators for each objective, outlined in the implementation matrix. For example, the outcome for the overall objective of the prevention pillar lists ""Number of research initiatives conducted on the root causes of conflict and violent extremism, the role of women, and their effect on women as an indicator. The annual progress of the NAP'ss implementation will be jointly monitored by the Coordination Group and the Consultative Platform through a multi-tier monitoring plan. The Coordination Group will develop a ""standard, results-based reporting template p. 13 to monitor the NAP. Based on the indicators identified in the monitoring framework, sex and age-disaggregated data will be collected. Each ministry and department or division represented on the Coordination Group will appoint a contact person to lead internal monitoring and reporting. Additionally, Bangladesh'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs will oversee the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation team. Relevant ministries and departments or divisions will submit annual progress reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The monitoring and evaluation team will then consolidate these reports and present them to the Coordination Group and the Consultative Platform for review and feedback. Finally, a thorough review of the overall NAP implementation will be conducted at the end of three years, and the NAP may be revised for a further period upon consultations with stakeholders. The NAP indicates that the action plan ""will be funded primarily by the state budgeting mechanism and that each responsible ministry will incorporate WPS actions into their individual budget, which is already gender-responsive. Additionally, the NAP states that ""additional resources from prospective international and multinational development partners will be sought p. 12. However, the NAP does not include an overall allocated or estimated budget. The NAP does not address disarmament or demilitarization."

15,Belgium,5,1,1,,,"Belgium adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2021. The drafting of the NAP was coordinated by the Institute for the Equality of Women and Men and the FPS Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, in collaboration with the Ministry of Defense, the FPS Interior and the SPF Justice as well as consultations with civil society. The NAP identifies several overarching objectives: to promote the implementation of an international regulatory framework; to integrate gender perspectives in the actions taken by Belgium in conflicts, peace, and security; to fight against all forms of violence against women and girls, and specifically sexual violence; to encourage women to participate in processes regarding conflict, peace, and security; and to ensure the oversight and monitoring of the implementation of the WPS Agenda and of the NAP. Each objective has corresponding goals, actions, indicators, and responsible parties, but does not include an allocated budget. Belgium'ss third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs adopted in 2008 and 2013 and implemented for the period 2008-2012 and 2013-2016, respectively. Both the second and third NAPs have standalone sections devoted to lessons learned from the implementation of the previous NAPs. Even though all three NAPs have an international focus in the implementation of the WPS agenda, the second and third NAPs do emphasize the importance of focusing on gender equality and promoting gender mainstreaming across national institutions in Belgium. Different from the first two NAPs, the third NAP also addresses disarmament and arms control, including embracing a ""gender-based approach” with regards to decisions and actions within arms treaties and conventions. Belgium does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a key contributor to UN peacekeeping missions and NATO operations. Furthermore, Belgium continues to export arms to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which perpetuates and exacerbates the gendered impact of arms transfers. Belgium is a major contributor to development aid and humanitarian assistance, including being a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019 , the Belgian parliament adopted a law to establish a human rights institution at the federal level. Despite this development, civil society activists have raised concerns about the overall violation of migrants's rights in the country. At the multilateral level, Belgium most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2019-2020.",1985,54,2014,4.818B,"NAP Development
The NAP was submitted to civil society for consideration at a consultation meeting organised by the FPS Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation.
WILPF does not have a country section in Belgium and therefore was not involved in the development process of Belgium'ss NAP.
The drafting of this third NAP was coordinated by the Institute for Equality of Women and Men and the FPS Business Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, in collaboration with the Ministry of Defense, the SPF Interior and the SPF Justice. 
NAP Implementation
This NAP does not fully recognise the hard work of civil society. The NAP does state that consultations with external actors, including civil society and local women's organizations, is necessary in order to better identify their needs and priorities and to find greater support for peace initiatives proposed by women. While the importance of consultations is mentioned, there is only one goal (Objective 6, Goal 35) that demonstrates Belgium'ss want to act in this regard: ""Inform and involve civil society. Ensure the exchange of information, gender expertise available in Belgium and consultations with civil society, at least in the middle and at the end of the period covered by the NAP”. Indicators include: ""Organization of two reporting and consultation events. Number of civil society organizations involved”.
At the federal level, there is a gender mainstreaming law that requires all administrations to integrate gender within its politics, measures, budget preparations and actions. Every intervention must integrate gender.
The framework for implementation of the NAP comprises of several parts. The NAP contains six objectives, each of which contains several goals, action steps and indicators. Each department mentioned is responsible for specific goals, action steps and indicators. These include: Affaires Étrangères (Foreign Affairs), Développement (Development), Défense (Defense), Intérieur (Interior), Justice (Justice), Égalité (Equality), Intérieur-OE (Interior OE), Intérieur-CGRA/OE (Interior CGRA/OE), Intérieur-Fedasil (Interior-Fedasil) and Intérieur-POLFED (Interior-POLFED). For example, Objective 3, ""Fight against all forms of violence against women and girls, and more specifically sexual violence”, contains the goal ""Impose on Belgian peacekeeping forces zero tolerance on violence against women”. The action is ""Prosecute perpetrators of sexual violence in the defense department”, and the indicator is ""Ratio of the number of complaints to the number of prosecutions. Ratio of the number of prosecutions to the number of convictions”. The department in charge of achieving all of this is the Defense Department.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society does not have an important role in the monitoring and evaluation process.
There is an annual report submitted to the Parliament, which gathers information about the actions carried out during the previous year, so the Parliament can stay informed of the progress achieved and to ensure regular monitoring of the NAP.",The implementation period for the National Plan of Action of Belgium is five years (2017-2021).,"By 2021, the commitments of Belgium towards Women, Peace and Security are to be realised through the following objectives:
Objective 1: Promote the implementation of the international normative framework;
Objective 2: Integrate a gender dimension into Belgian actions in conflict, peace and security;
Objective 3: Fight against all forms of violence against women and girls, and more specifically sexual violence;
Objective 4: Promote women's participation in processes concerning conflict, peace and security;
Objective 5: Support the Women, Peace and Security Agenda;
Objective 6: Assure that the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and the NAP are followed and monitored.","Each objective has different goals, actions, indicators and departments assigned to achieve these. For example, Objective 1 ""Promote the implementation of the international normative framework” includes the following:
Goal 1.: Ensure that treaties and conventions concerning the improvement of the situation and the empowerment of women are taken into account:
Action 1a: Apply in Belgium the international conventions that ensure the rights of women;
Action 1b: Continue to intervene actively in the of the United Nations (General Assembly, CSW, Council human rights, etc.) to put forward women's rights, particularly in countries in (post-) conflict;
Action 1c: Call all countries systematically to subscribe and respect the conventions that ensure the rights of women.
Goal 2: Promote the position of women, particularly in countries in situations of fragility:
Action 2a: Give priority and financial support to gender equality and empowerment of women, especially in fragile countries;
Action 2b: Approach all political advocacy, international declarations and interventions in the field on the basis of a strategic and coherent framework to strengthen women's empowerment;
Action 2c: Offer expertise and participate in the exchange of good practices;
Action 2d: Support UN Women and its advocacy role in relation to the equality of women and men and women's empowerment;
Action 2e: Continue to support the mandate of the UN on laws and practices discriminatory against women;
Action 2f: Support the OSCE Special Representative Action Plan for the Promotion of Gender Equality;
Action 2g: Act in the context of political advocacy and international declarations;
Goal 3: Ensuring respect for the health and sexual and reproductive rights of women:
Action 3a: Integrate respect for sexual health and rights, and reproductive health, into humanitarian aid programs and Reconstruction programs;
Action 3b: Call on all countries to ensure respect for the health and sexual and reproductive rights of women and defend these rights at the international level;
Action 3c: Advocate for the mention of health and sexual and reproductive rights in international agreements.
Goal 4: Improve the legal framework and rules of procedure so that women can have better access to justice (national/international):
Action 4a: Financially support the funds of the International Criminal Court in favor of victims;
Action 4b: Support initiatives that facilitate women and girls's access to
justice, to ensure protection of their rights (land/inheritance/discrimination etc.);
Action 4c: Call on all countries to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court;
Action 4d: Call on all countries to apply the broadest definition of sexual violence.","To achieve each objective, the NAP has different indicators assigned. For example, Objective 1 (""Promote the implementation of the international normative framework”), Goal 1 (""Ensure that treaties and conventions concerning the improvement of the situation and the empowerment of women are taken into account”), includes the following indicators:
Indicator 1a: Periodic reporting under CEDAW. Tracking reporting issues and relevant questionnaires. Follow-up to the Istanbul Convention;
Indicator 1b: UN Actions (CSW, Council of human rights, etc.);
Indicator 1c: Interventions made. Calls in the context of policies and agreements concluded.","The revised Belgian NAP includes the names of departments responsible for the implementation of the lines of action. While the indicators may also count as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, there is no specific monitoring and evaluation framework offered in the NAP.
In 2010, Civil Society was charged with evaluating the NAP in cooperation with the government. In the new version, evaluation bodies are not clearly defined.","There is no total cost of the NAP implementation mentioned in this NAP. The implementation of the NAP mentions various government sectors in terms of funding Women, Peace and Security. The NAP calls for using all financial means set aside for international cooperation should be used in a way that supports women'ss empowerment.
The NAP does not elaborate on plans, strategies or mechanisms to ensure activities are funded within departmental budgets. However, the Belgium NAP notes that they have existing gender-sensitive budget requirements under its federal legislation. 
No indicators or actions are included that formulate strategies for sourcing increased funding, detail what level of funding is required for which specific activities, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP.","The NAP includes specific actions on arms control and disarmament, including:
Ensure compliance at all times with article 7.4 within the framework of the implementation of the Treaty on the Arms Trade (ban on exports in cases of ‘Gender-Based violence/violence Against Women and children's).
Support the full and meaningful participation of women in the fight against the illegal trafficking and misuse of small arms and low caliber weapons.
Promoting the gender-based approach, and more specifically, the SPF resolutions in the joint Positions and decisions of the European Council regarding disarmament and the outreach by various treaties and conventions relating to disarmament and arms control, and the Interventions carried out.

",1,Western Europe,"Belgium adopted its most recent National Action Plan NAP in 2017 for the period 2017-2021. The drafting of the NAP was coordinated by the Institute for the Equality of Women and Men and the FPS Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, in collaboration with the Ministry of Defense, the FPS Interior and the SPF Justice as well as consultations with civil society. The NAP identifies several overarching objectives: to promote the implementation of an international regulatory framework; to integrate gender perspectives in the actions taken by Belgium in conflicts, peace, and security; to fight against all forms of violence against women and girls, and specifically sexual violence; to encourage women to participate in processes regarding conflict, peace, and security; and to ensure the oversight and monitoring of the implementation of the WPS Agenda and of the NAP. Each objective has corresponding goals, actions, indicators, and responsible parties, but does not include an allocated budget. Belgium'ss third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs adopted in 2008 and 2013 and implemented for the period 2008-2012 and 2013-2016, respectively. Both the second and third NAPs have standalone sections devoted to lessons learned from the implementation of the previous NAPs. Even though all three NAPs have an international focus in the implementation of the WPS agenda, the second and third NAPs do emphasize the importance of focusing on gender equality and promoting gender mainstreaming across national institutions in Belgium. Different from the first two NAPs, the third NAP also addresses disarmament and arms control, including embracing a ""gender-based approach with regards to decisions and actions within arms treaties and conventions. Belgium does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a key contributor to UN peacekeeping missions and NATO operations. Furthermore, Belgium continues to export arms to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which perpetuates and exacerbates the gendered impact of arms transfers. Belgium is a major contributor to development aid and humanitarian assistance, including being a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019 , the Belgian parliament adopted a law to establish a human rights institution at the federal level. Despite this development, civil society activists have raised concerns about the overall violation of migrants's rights in the country. At the multilateral level, Belgium most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2019-2020. By 2021, the commitments of Belgium towards Women, Peace and Security are to be realised through the following objectives: Objective 1: Promote the implementation of the international normative framework; Objective 2: Integrate a gender dimension into Belgian actions in conflict, peace and security; Objective 3: Fight against all forms of violence against women and girls, and more specifically sexual violence; Objective 4: Promote women's participation in processes concerning conflict, peace and security; Objective 5: Support the Women, Peace and Security Agenda; Objective 6: Assure that the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and the NAP are followed and monitored. Each objective has different goals, actions, indicators and departments assigned to achieve these. For example, Objective 1 ""Promote the implementation of the international normative framework includes the following: Goal 1.: Ensure that treaties and conventions concerning the improvement of the situation and the empowerment of women are taken into account: Action 1a: Apply in Belgium the international conventions that ensure the rights of women; Action 1b: Continue to intervene actively in the of the United Nations General Assembly, CSW, Council human rights, etc. to put forward women's rights, particularly in countries in post- conflict; Action 1c: Call all countries systematically to subscribe and respect the conventions that ensure the rights of women. Goal 2: Promote the position of women, particularly in countries in situations of fragility: Action 2a: Give priority and financial support to gender equality and empowerment of women, especially in fragile countries; Action 2b: Approach all political advocacy, international declarations and interventions in the field on the basis of a strategic and coherent framework to strengthen women's empowerment; Action 2c: Offer expertise and participate in the exchange of good practices; Action 2d: Support UN Women and its advocacy role in relation to the equality of women and men and women's empowerment; Action 2e: Continue to support the mandate of the UN on laws and practices discriminatory against women; Action 2f: Support the OSCE Special Representative Action Plan for the Promotion of Gender Equality; Action 2g: Act in the context of political advocacy and international declarations; Goal 3: Ensuring respect for the health and sexual and reproductive rights of women: Action 3a: Integrate respect for sexual health and rights, and reproductive health, into humanitarian aid programs and Reconstruction programs; Action 3b: Call on all countries to ensure respect for the health and sexual and reproductive rights of women and defend these rights at the international level; Action 3c: Advocate for the mention of health and sexual and reproductive rights in international agreements. Goal 4: Improve the legal framework and rules of procedure so that women can have better access to justice nationalinternational: Action 4a: Financially support the funds of the International Criminal Court in favor of victims; Action 4b: Support initiatives that facilitate women and girls's access to justice, to ensure protection of their rights landinheritancediscrimination etc.; Action 4c: Call on all countries to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; Action 4d: Call on all countries to apply the broadest definition of sexual violence. To achieve each objective, the NAP has different indicators assigned. For example, Objective 1 ""Promote the implementation of the international normative framework, Goal 1 ""Ensure that treaties and conventions concerning the improvement of the situation and the empowerment of women are taken into account, includes the following indicators: Indicator 1a: Periodic reporting under CEDAW. Tracking reporting issues and relevant questionnaires. Follow-up to the Istanbul Convention; Indicator 1b: UN Actions CSW, Council of human rights, etc.; Indicator 1c: Interventions made. Calls in the context of policies and agreements concluded. The revised Belgian NAP includes the names of departments responsible for the implementation of the lines of action. While the indicators may also count as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, there is no specific monitoring and evaluation framework offered in the NAP. In 2010, Civil Society was charged with evaluating the NAP in cooperation with the government. In the new version, evaluation bodies are not clearly defined. There is no total cost of the NAP implementation mentioned in this NAP. The implementation of the NAP mentions various government sectors in terms of funding Women, Peace and Security. The NAP calls for using all financial means set aside for international cooperation should be used in a way that supports women'ss empowerment. The NAP does not elaborate on plans, strategies or mechanisms to ensure activities are funded within departmental budgets. However, the Belgium NAP notes that they have existing gender-sensitive budget requirements under its federal legislation. No indicators or actions are included that formulate strategies for sourcing increased funding, detail what level of funding is required for which specific activities, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP. The NAP includes specific actions on arms control and disarmament, including: Ensure compliance at all times with article 7.4 within the framework of the implementation of the Treaty on the Arms Trade ban on exports in cases of Gender-Based violenceviolence Against Women and children's. Support the full and meaningful participation of women in the fight against the illegal trafficking and misuse of small arms and low caliber weapons. Promoting the gender-based approach, and more specifically, the SPF resolutions in the joint Positions and decisions of the European Council regarding disarmament and the outreach by various treaties and conventions relating to disarmament and arms control, and the Interventions carried out.

23,Brazil,6,1,1,,,"Brazil adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017, for the period 2017-2019, and was subsequently renewed for four years . It adopted its second NAP in 2023. The 2017 NAP was developed by an interministerial working group, which consisted of the Ministries Foreign Affairs; Defense; Justice; Public Security; and Human Rights, with a participatory approach that included consultations with civil society organizations. The NAP identifies four major goals that aim to increase the participation of women in international peace and security; prevent gender-based violence and promote the human rights of all women and girls before, during, and after conflict; strengthen humanitarian actions through a gender-sensitive framework; and expand awareness of the WPS agenda within Brazil. While each objective has corresponding actions, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. Brazil reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates: Considering that the National Plan of Action on Women, Peace and Security will soon reach its term, the review process has already begun. As in the preparation of the text of the NPA, the review process is led by the Inter‐ministerial Working Group, coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and encompassing the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Justice and Public Safety, Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights, UN‐Women and Instituto Igarapé as a representative of civil society. The review process began in 1 November 2018, in Brasília, with a seminar entitled ""National Plan of Action on Women, Peace and Security: implementation and review”. This event, organized in partnership with the Alexandre de Gusmão Foundation (FUNAG), included representatives from governmental agencies, military officials, foreign governments and civil society. The debates provided conclusions and suggestions that inform the efforts to review the NPA. Among those, the importance of effective and continuous monitoring mechanisms on national plans was particularly highlighted. There has also been opinions in support of broadening the scope of participation and capacity training of non‐military women (diplomats, police officers and civilians) in peacekeeping operations, special political missions, negotiations on peace and security issues and mediation. Brazil does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but went through a period of military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985. To this date, impunity persists for human rights violations by military officers, with a 1979 amnesty law, which was upheld in 2010 by the country'ss supreme court, protecting perpetrators. Brazil experiences deep socioeconomic inequalities, with protests erupting over public funds spent for the World Cup in 2014 as well as the mistreatment of marginalized residents and laborers. Brazil has a vibrant feminist movement , and women across the country are working to protect and promote women'ss human rights, including through the participation of women'ss civil society organizations in institutions such as the National Council on Women'ss Rights . In 2019, Brazil was among the top 15 countries with the highest military expenditure as well as being among the top 25 arms exporters in the world. At the multilateral level, Brazil most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2010-2011.",1994,92,2014,27B,"The analysis in these tabs corresponds to the 2017 NAP.
NAP Development
Civil society members Instituto Igarapé supported the development of Brazil'ss NAP and contributed the development of support for the NAP by organising consultations with government institutions, civil society organisations and experts from academia.
WILPF does not have a country section in Brazil and therefore was not involved in the development process of Brazil'ss NAP.
Prior the official launch of the NAP, Brazil has undertook several attempts to broaden women'ss participation  in decision-making, security and peacekeeping. These initiatives include the Multi-Year Plan (2012-2015) and the National Plan of policies for Women.
Since August 2015, the preparation of the Plan was carried out by the Working Group, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives of the Ministry of Defense including the three Armed Forces, and the Ministries of Justice and Public Security and Human Rights and the Ministry of Justice and Citizenship, with participation of Instituto Igarapé and Pandiá Calógeras.
NAP Implementation
Civil society will support the NAP'ss implementation, educate and expand their cooperation with the ministries that implement the NAP.
The Brazilian NAP will be implemented by government officials, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defense and the Brazilian Government.  
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society does not have an important role in monitoring and evaluation. According to the NAP, civil society and other actors will be used to spread the ""knowledge and engagement about the National Action Plan in Brazil.”
The actors for monitoring and evaluating are the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Relations, Justice and Public Security, and Human Rights. Their roles are to monitor mechanisms of the NAP'ss implementation by creating reports on the measures taken to meet the objectives and activities, the progress made, and the challenges identified.",The implementation period for the Brazilian National Plan of Action is two years starting in March 2017. The NAP was later renewed for four subsequent years.,"Brazil'ss National Action Plan is organised by four Pillars as follows:
Pillar 1: To increase the effective participation of Brazilian women in international peace and security activities, including in leadership positions and promote the effective participation of local women;
Pillar 2: To expand and improve Brazil'ss contribution to tackle gender-based violence and to protect the human rights of all women and girls in conflict situations, pre and post-conflict;
Pillar 3: To strengthen the gender perspective in Brazil's role in  the development and execution of consolidation of peace and humanitarian activities of cooperation;
Pillar 4: To expand awareness of the WPS Agenda in Brazilian society.","Each pillar has different actions assigned. For example, Pillar 1 ""to increase the effective participation of Brazilian women in international peace and security activities, including in leadership positions and promote the effective participation of local women” includes the following actions:
Increase the sense of security of the local population and extends the range of peace operations skills;
Facilitate the inclusion of ex-combatant women during the process of demobilisation and reintegration into society;
Expand information of collection networks;
Contribute to interviews with survivors of gender-based violence;
Promote a better interaction with women in local societies and serve as a model for local women;
Have women contribute as instructors at military academies.",The NAP does not identify any indicators towards the implementation of its actions/activities.,"The reporting and review processes are follow-up tasks of NAP compliance from Gender Commissions and/or specific committees's contributions. At the end of 2018, the Working Group will reconvene in order to assess the Plan'ss implementation and make any necessary adjustments. Any desire to make a new NAP during the implementation period will be discussed by the Working Group, which will present its recommendations to the institutions and bodies involved.","Brazil does not include an allocated or estimated budget. No actions are included that formulate strategies for sourcing increased funding, detail what level of funding is required for which specific activities, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP.","The National Action Plan does not address disarmament issues or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity. Instead, Brazilian NAP showcases the intention of the Government to re-frame women'ss role in society so that women see themselves as key participants in the country'ss defense sector, rather than addressing intransigent obstacles to women'ss participation and rights.","Lei N"" 10.224, altera o Decreto-Lei n"" 2.848, de 7 de dezembro de 1940  Cdigo Penal: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

A Consultative Working Group was established in 2019, and is led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The Working Group consists of experts from relevant government institutions, representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and independent academic experts.  On 2 October 2019, the Working Group hosted a roundtable discussion in order to have a public consultation.  Development of Bulgaria'ss NAP took place with the collaboration of Ireland, which shared its experience and expertise in WPS implementation. 
NAP Implementation
Implementation will be a joint effort among several institutions, including various ministries such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Defence, and Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Various military training academies and schools are also responsible for NAP implementation, including the Military Medical Academy, and G.S. Rakovski National Defence College.  Other actors include the Social Assistance Agency, the Child Protection Commission, the National Institute of Justice, the National Commission for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, the Supreme Prosecutors's Office of Appeals, the National Social Security Institute, and NGOs.
NAP monitoring and evaluation
Monitoring of the NAP will be a shared responsibility among institutions. ",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2020-2025.,"Bulgaria'ss NAP is organized around four pillars. 
Prevention: preventing violence and promoting gender equality within law enforcement, peace and security processes (including non-violent conflict mediation and resolution), governmental policies, and the general public.  This pillar incorporates relevant strategic documents including the National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality.
Participation: promoting and supporting the active and effective participation of women in all peace processes and in formal and informal decision-making at all levels, as well as maintaining a policy of balanced gender representation in international and regional organizations.
Protection: strengthening efforts to ensure the safety, physical and mental health, wellbeing, economic security, and dignity of women and girls, to promote and protect women'ss rights (including within the contexts of armed conflict and post-conflict reconstruction), and to mainstream gender equality.
Prioritization: relates to Bulgaria's contributions to the WPS agenda within the EU framework and the prioritization of WPS in the country'ss commitments within NATO, the UN, multilateral and regional initiatives, including those in the field of arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament.","Each of the four pillars in Bulgaria'ss NAP is divided into a subset of goals.  Each of these goals has a relevant set of measures, actions, and responsible institutions.  
For example, Pillar 3 of Protection contains three goals.  Goal 3.1., ‘Protection of the rights of women and girls during an armed conflict and in the post-conflict reconstruction process and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls's, is divided into five measures, including (p. 22): ‘3.1.2. Optimization of the funding and reporting of activities relating to gender equality in conflict-affected areas within the framework of development cooperation and humanitarian aid policy's. This has two associated actions.","Each action in Bulgaria'ss NAP has a set of indicators and a timeframe.  For example, under Pillar 1 of Prevention, the action ‘Active involvement of women mediators in programmes and trainings for nonviolent resolution of disputes and conflicts's includes four indicators, for example, the number of trainings and programmes implemented and the number of participating women mediators.  The timeframe for this action is 2020-2025.  ","The NAP states monitoring will be a shared responsibility among institutions and a review will begin in the second half of 2022 (p.4).  However, the NAP does not set out a specific monitoring and evaluation framework or process.","Each action within Bulgaria's NAP has an associated budget, however it is not specified in the document.  Rather, under budget, it states that the NAP will be implemented ‘Within the budget allocations for the relevant institutions's, in reference to the budget of listed responsible institutions.","Under Pillar 4 of Prioritization, Bulgaria'ss NAP sets out that it will promote the principles of the WPS agenda within regional and multilateral initiatives on arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament (p. 28).

26,Burkina Faso,11,1,1,,20,"Burkina Faso has adopted a new National Action Plan (NAP) on WPS for the period 2023-2025. Analysis is forthcoming. Burkina Faso adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2012 for the period 2013-2016. The NAP was developed by the Ministry for Women'ss Promotion and the Ministry of Human Rights and Civil Promotion. The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in its development. The NAP identifies four overarching goals: protecting and rehabilitating women and girls who have been victims from violence; integrating a gender dimension in security and defence governance; preventing violence against women and girls; and raising awareness on violence against women and girls. These goals have corresponding objectives, actions, indicators, a monitoring and evaluation framework, and an estimated budget. Burkina Faso reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates (pp. 52-53): The establishment in 2014 of a working group on women peace and security in West Africa and the Sahel section of Burkina Faso, coordinated by the Ministry in charge of women; The establishment in 2015 of a national women'ss unit of the G5 Sahel in charge of facilitating the integration and consideration of women'ss specific priorities in order to contribute to the development and stability of the Sahel; Advocacy with the authorities for the involvement of women in peacekeeping operations; With a view to taking into account resolution 2242 of October 13, 2015 on strengthening actions in favor of the women, peace and security program, the national action plan for 2018 was reviewed. Burkina Faso gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule by the French empire. The country experienced four military coups (1966, 1983, 1987, and 2015) after its independence, contributing to ongoing political instability. Since 2019, the clashes between armed Islamist groups and state security forces have exacerbated insecurity for the people of Burkina Faso. Currently, over 1 million people are internally displaced , while over 2.5 million people remain in humanitarian need. Furthermore, the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is contributing to the growing insecurity of women, including through an increase in gender-based violence. In 2019, Burkina Faso was among the top 10 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 22% increase in its military spending.",1987,108,,358M,"NAP Development

The Burkina Faso NAP covers the period 2013-2016. The time frame is split into three periods: 2013-2014; 2014-2015; and 2015-2016. For each period, a table displays the timeframe for the implementation of each activity underlying the goal.",,"The NAP is structured by four goals and six objectives.  The following goals are:
Protecting and rehabilitating women and girls who have been victims from violence
Integrating a gender dimension in Security and Defence governance
Preventing violence against women and girls
Raising awareness on violence against women and girls
The NAP has six objectives which are:
Ensure and promote the systematic integration of the gender dimension in the process for human rights protection, justice and security reform.
Protect women and girls against sexual and gender-based violence
Prevent violence against women and girls through women'ss rights promotion, accountability and law enforcement
Achieve women'ss participation at all decision-making levels
Ensure parties involved in armed conflicts put an end to all forms of sexual violence against civilians and especially against women and girls
Ensure parties involved in armed conflict immediately take action to protect civilians, and especially women and girls, against all forms of sexual violence","Each objective relies on activities. For example, the first objective of the first goal is ""Enhance care processes for women and girls who have been victims of violence”.  The activities for this objective include: 
Creating structures in the 13 counties to support and take care of victims
Strengthening the capacity of listening centers put in place by the OSC
Informing populations and raising their awareness on the existence of support structures and shelters for women and girls who have been victims of violence
Strengthening the capacity of health workers, security staff members and justice officials to enhance care processes for women and girls who have been victims of violence
Strengthen the OSC'ss ability to create shelter for women and girls who have been victims of violence","A table summarizes which indicators will be used to track the progress on implementing a specific objective (i.e. not on the activity level, which means that the monitoring process will evaluate results on an objective level).
For instance, the following indicators have been defined for the first objective:
Enhancing care processes for women and girls who have been victims of violence
Number of teams created for gathering complaints, supporting and taking care of women and girls who have been victims of sexual-based violence
Number of women and girls who have been victims of sexual-based violence that are now being taken care of
Satisfaction level of the women and girls who are being taken care of
To be noted, some indicators are not quantifiable or qualitative. For instance, with laws protecting women and girls, monitors will only check for the existence of such laws and there are no explicit criteria for assessing it.
Monitoring and Evaluation
A table summarizes who is responsible for the implementation of each objective and the results expected for each objective. The bodies who will be in charge of the implementation are: the Ministry of Women'ss Promotion, Ministry of National Defence and Veterans; Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Cooperation; Ministry of National Education and Literacy; Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education; Ministry of Scientific Research and Information and Ministry of Human Rights and Civic Promotion. The sources for monitoring are also detailed.",,"The total budget for implementing this NAP is approximately $3.6mln (mentioned in CFA francs in the report), split as following: $1.3mln in 2014, $1.2mln in 2015 and $1.1mln in 2016. For each goal, a table displays the budget allocated to the implementation of each activity underlying the goal per year.",The NAP does not address disarmament.,"Comit National De Lutte Contre La Pratique De L'excision Cnlpe: Institutional mechanisms

",2,Sub-Saharan Africa,"Burkina Faso has adopted a new National Action Plan NAP on WPS for the period 2023-2025. Analysis is forthcoming. Burkina Faso adopted its first National Action Plan NAP in 2012 for the period 2013-2016. The NAP was developed by the Ministry for Women'ss Promotion and the Ministry of Human Rights and Civil Promotion. The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in its development. The NAP identifies four overarching goals: protecting and rehabilitating women and girls who have been victims from violence; integrating a gender dimension in security and defence governance; preventing violence against women and girls; and raising awareness on violence against women and girls. These goals have corresponding objectives, actions, indicators, a monitoring and evaluation framework, and an estimated budget. Burkina Faso reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Specifically, the country provided the following updates pp. 52-53: The establishment in 2014 of a working group on women peace and security in West Africa and the Sahel section of Burkina Faso, coordinated by the Ministry in charge of women; The establishment in 2015 of a national women'ss unit of the G5 Sahel in charge of facilitating the integration and consideration of women'ss specific priorities in order to contribute to the development and stability of the Sahel; Advocacy with the authorities for the involvement of women in peacekeeping operations; With a view to taking into account resolution 2242 of October 13, 2015 on strengthening actions in favor of the women, peace and security program, the national action plan for 2018 was reviewed. Burkina Faso gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule by the French empire. The country experienced four military coups 1966, 1983, 1987, and 2015 after its independence, contributing to ongoing political instability. Since 2019, the clashes between armed Islamist groups and state security forces have exacerbated insecurity for the people of Burkina Faso. Currently, over 1 million people are internally displaced , while over 2.5 million people remain in humanitarian need. Furthermore, the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is contributing to the growing insecurity of women, including through an increase in gender-based violence. In 2019, Burkina Faso was among the top 10 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 22 increase in its military spending. The NAP is structured by four goals and six objectives. The following goals are: Protecting and rehabilitating women and girls who have been victims from violence Integrating a gender dimension in Security and Defence governance Preventing violence against women and girls Raising awareness on violence against women and girls The NAP has six objectives which are: Ensure and promote the systematic integration of the gender dimension in the process for human rights protection, justice and security reform. Protect women and girls against sexual and gender-based violence Prevent violence against women and girls through women'ss rights promotion, accountability and law enforcement Achieve women'ss participation at all decision-making levels Ensure parties involved in armed conflicts put an end to all forms of sexual violence against civilians and especially against women and girls Ensure parties involved in armed conflict immediately take action to protect civilians, and especially women and girls, against all forms of sexual violence Each objective relies on activities. For example, the first objective of the first goal is ""Enhance care processes for women and girls who have been victims of violence. The activities for this objective include: Creating structures in the 13 counties to support and take care of victims Strengthening the capacity of listening centers put in place by the OSC Informing populations and raising their awareness on the existence of support structures and shelters for women and girls who have been victims of violence Strengthening the capacity of health workers, security staff members and justice officials to enhance care processes for women and girls who have been victims of violence Strengthen the OSC'ss ability to create shelter for women and girls who have been victims of violence A table summarizes which indicators will be used to track the progress on implementing a specific objective i.e. not on the activity level, which means that the monitoring process will evaluate results on an objective level.

The sources for monitoring are also detailed. The total budget for implementing this NAP is approximately 3.6mln mentioned in CFA francs in the report, split as following: 1.3mln in 2014, 1.2mln in 2015 and 1.1mln in 2016. For each goal, a table displays the budget allocated to the implementation of each activity underlying the goal per year. The NAP does not address disarmament."
27,Burundi,22,1,1,40.3,22.8,"Burundi adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2022 for the period 2022-2027. Based on the framework for the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), the government of Burundi has developed and implemented two prior National Action Plans: the first, for the period 2012-2016 and the second for the period 2017-2021, and has adopted a third NAP for the period 2022-2027. The evaluation of the second NAP revealed that problems in Burundi persist regarding the women, peace and security agenda, particularly the full inclusion of women in peace-consolidation mechanisms and decision-making positions, as well as their economic independence and autonomy. The third NAP'ss process of development was deeply intertwined with the second'ss NAP evaluation. The Ministry of National Solidarity, Social Affairs, Human Rights and Gender was in charge of collecting and validating the data from 25 institutions and organizations that work on WPS, including Ministries and State Institutions, NGOs and financial and technical partners. Furthermore, four regional consultation workshops were held which identified the successes, obstacles encountered, challenges and recommendations that were the basis for the 2022-2027 Action Plan. Burundi'ss NAP is structured around several axes: Promotion of UNSCR 1325 Equality and equity in men and women'ss participation in decision-making positions and in peace-consolidation mechanisms Reinforce the legal framework for the prevention of conflicts and violence against women and girls Protection of rights and care for victims of sexual and gender-based violence Involvement of women and taking into account the needs of women and girls for the development and implementation of economic recovery programs Coordination and mobilization of financing for the implementation of NAP 2022-2027. Burundi gained independence from Belgium in 1962, after an extensive period of colonial rule by the Belgian empire. The most recent armed conflict in Burundi'ss history is the civil war, which started in 1993 following a military coup. The conflict resulted in the death and displacement of thousands of people. The Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement was signed in 2000, where women'ss civil society members acted as formal observers. In 2015, Burundi witnessed a failed coup attempt, which led to ongoing social and political instability in the country, including human rights violations perpetrated by security forces. On the ground, women have played a key role in working towards preventing further violence and conflict through their role as mediators. In 2017, the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation regarding crimes against humanity in Burundi. Burundi then became the first country to leave the ICC.",1992,,,66.8M,"Development
The Ministry of National Solidarity, Social Affairs, Human Rights and Gender was responsible for the development of the third Action Plan for Burundi.

Monitoring and Evaluation
The Monitoring of the Action Plan for 2022-2027 will be the responsibility of a Steering Committee that will include personnel from diverse actors including the ministries concerned, UN Agencies in Burundi and national and international NGOs. This Committee is chaired by the Permanent Secretariat of the Ministry of National Solidarity, Social Affairs, Human Rights and Gender and vice-chaired by UN Women.

The most recent armed conflict in Burundi'ss history is the civil war, which started in 1993 following a military coup. The conflict resulted in the death and displacement of thousands of people. The Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement was signed in 2000, where women'ss civil society members acted as formal observers. In 2015, Burundi witnessed a failed coup attempt, which led to ongoing social and political instability in the country, including human rights violations perpetrated by security forces. On the ground, women have played a key role in working towards preventing further violence and conflict through their role as mediators. In 2017, the International Criminal Court ICC opened an investigation regarding crimes against humanity in Burundi. Burundi then became the first country to leave the ICC. Burundi'ss third NAP has established a series of 10 objectives, all of which correspond to an axis. These are: Promote UNSCR 1325 and the implementation of the NAP 2022-2027. Contribute to a mentality change and the promotion of positive masculinities and femininities. Reinforce women'ss leadership at all levels. Promote the level of representation of women and girls in the defense and security sectors. Improve the level of representation of women in the peace consolidation mechanisms Improve and implement the legal framework regarding gender equality. Increase access to local and quality care services and ensure free medical certificates Reduce the arduousness of housework for women and girls. Support the economic recovery of women and girls and their involvement in the development and implementation of community development programs and projects. Reinforce the coordination and the mobilization of funds for the implementation of the NAP 2022-2027 of UNSCR 1325. The Burundian Action Plan establishes 99 activities to be implemented, all of which correspond to the established objectives and the expected results. Examples of these include: Organize open days on UNSCR 1325 and the NAP 2022-2027; Organize training sessions for women, men, boys and girls on the promotion of positive masculinity and femininity; Organize awareness sessions on sexual and reproductive health in each of the categories of defense and security corps; Implement an assistance fund for victims of sexual and gender-based violence; Support the implementation of community childcare centers. Burundi'ss NAP established 17 expected results, all of which have the axis as a correspondent framework and are linked with the activities. Moreover, there are indicators to the activities as well. Examples of these include: Result 1.1.1: Stakeholders and communities become aware of UNSCR 1325 and the 2022-2027 NAP. Indicator 2: Number of actors having benefited from the UNSCR 1325 and the 2022-2027 NAP. Result 1.1.2: Stakeholders take ownership of UNSCR 1325 and the 2022-2027 action plan. Indicator 1: Number of of stakeholders committed to implementing the 2022-2027 action plan on UNSCR 1325 Result 2.2.3: Men and Women adopt a behavior positive to gender equality Indicator 2: Number of sexual and gender-based violence cases that were judged and made the responsibles accountable Result 2.3.4: Men and Women can access and participate equitably and effectively in political and technical positions and in decision-making bodies. Indicator 3: Percentage of men and women in technical positions and decision making positions in the public sector Beyond the actors involved in the Monitoring and Evaluation Process, there is no further information on the monitoring and evaluation process. The NAP recognizes the need of 73,280 million Burundian Francs for the entire implementation of the NAP. The NAP does not include actions on disarmament."

30,Cameroon,22,1,0,34.8,,"Cameroon'ss Second National Action Plan covers the years 2023 to 2027. The second NAP builds on the work conducted during the first NAP cycle and cites key lessons from the First-Generation NAP (2018-2020) that it seeks to address in the second NAP'ss implementation. These include: the lack of a robust coordination mechanism, the need for a clearer framework for collaboration and oversight, funding challenges, low participation of women in formal processes, and minimal community ownership. The second generation NAP also cites positive steps forward, such as the increased representation of women in political decision-making roles, with more women elected and appointed to leadership positions; and e nhanced involvement of CSOs, particularly women-led organizations, in promoting the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda and advocating for gender equality. Cameroon adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2018-2020. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Women'ss Empowerment and the Family, with technical and financial support from UN Women and contributions from the public administrations, civil society organisations, and community leaders. The main data for identifying NAP priorities was compiled by WILPF Cameroon, which also played a crucial role in mobilising Women, Peace and Security (WPS) efforts across the country and developing the NAP. Cameroon gained independence from France in 1960, after an extensive period of colonial rule under the German, British, and French empires. In the current moment, Cameroon experiences political instability as a result of the spillover effects of conflicts in neighboring countries, internal attacks by Boko Haram, and uprisings across the English-speaking areas of the country.

31,Canada,3,1,1,,27.2,"Canada adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2023-2029. This is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2017 for the period 2017-2022 and in 2010 for the period 2010-2016. Compared to the 2017–2022 National Action Plan, the 2023–2029 Foundations for Peace introduces several changes that reflect both lessons learned and evolving global challenges. These include: Domestic Commitments: The 2023–2029 NAP includes more extensive domestic commitments than previous plans. These address emerging global issues that also have local impacts, such as the rise in climate emergencies and the increase in technology-facilitated gender-based violence. Notably, the plan specifically acknowledges threats targeting women peacebuilders and human rights defenders both in Canada and abroad. Deeper Engagement with Indigenous Communities: The NAP places greater emphasis on addressing gender-based discrimination, violence, oppression, and marginalization faced by women in Canada, particularly Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people. It recognizes that leadership by Indigenous women and gender-diverse individuals is essential for achieving sustainable peace and security for all. Integration of an Intersectional Feminist Approach: Building on insights from previous plans, the 2023–2029 NAP further develops an intersectional feminist framework. In 2017, Canada adopted a Feminist International Assistance Policy. The policy'ss core priority is identified as gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, with five additional supporting priorities: human dignity; growth that works for everyone; environment and climate action; inclusive governance; and peace and security. Canada is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Canada is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Canada was UN Women 'ss seventh-largest other resources contributor with USD 9.6 million and the tenth-largest total government contributor with USD 14.4 million. At the multilateral level, Canada was most recently a candidate for a non-permanent position at the United Nations Security Council for the period 2021-2022, but was not elected.",1981,30,2019,26.9B,"The 2023–2029 NAP was developed and will be implemented by 11 federal partners: the Canadian Armed Forces and Department of National Defence, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, Department of Justice Canada, Global Affairs Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Indigenous Services Canada, Public Safety Canada (including the Correctional Service of Canada), Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Veterans Affairs Canada, Women and Gender Equality Canada, and the Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development.
Additionally, the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth plays an important oversight role in ensuring effective implementation across government.
Civil society organizations, including the Women, Peace and Security Network-Canada, co-chaired the advisory group and provided substantial input during the development process. The Government of Canada also engaged with Indigenous Peoples, women peacebuilders, human rights defenders, academics, and other civil society actors to shape a more inclusive and impactful action plan.",The National Action Plan covers the years from 2023 to 2029.,"Building and Sustaining Peace:
Strengthen gender-responsive and gender-transformative approaches to building and sustaining peace in Canada and abroad. This includes supporting women and gender-diverse peacebuilders and human rights defenders through targeted funding and policy support.
Security, Justice, and Accountability:
Improve security, justice, and accountability systems to better respond to the needs of women, girls, and gender-diverse people. This involves reforming security institutions to be more inclusive and addressing systemic harm.
Gender-Responsive Crisis Response:
Ensure crisis responses—both domestically and internationally—are gender-responsive. This includes integrating gender perspectives into disaster response, humanitarian aid, and peacekeeping operations.
Prevention and Response to Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV):
Enhance efforts to prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence, particularly in conflict and post-conflict situations, and strengthen accountability mechanisms for perpetrators.
Leadership and Capabilities:
Strengthen Canada'ss leadership and capabilities to advance the WPS agenda. This involves building institutional capacity and leveraging Canada'ss position in international organizations to champion gender equality and peace initiatives.
Inclusion:
Promote meaningful inclusion of marginalized and underrepresented groups, particularly Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people, in peace and security efforts. The NAP integrates anti-racism, decolonization, and intersectionality across all focus areas.","Key actions under the 2023–2029 National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security (NAP) include the establishment of a dedicated coordination hub at Global Affairs Canada to lead and oversee the implementation of the NAP across all partner departments and agencies. The plan prioritizes strengthening partnerships with civil society organizations, particularly Indigenous communities, women peacebuilders, and gender-diverse groups, to ensure their meaningful participation in peace and security decision-making at all levels.
Additionally, the NAP commits to providing flexible and sustained funding to women'ss rights organizations and feminist movements, both domestically and internationally, recognizing their critical role in advancing peace and security. The Government of Canada will further integrate gender perspectives into all aspects of military operations, security sector reforms, and crisis response planning, ensuring that interventions are inclusive and responsive to diverse needs.
The action plan also emphasizes building institutional capacity to address emerging global threats—such as climate-related security risks, cybersecurity threats, and technology-facilitated gender-based violence—through gender-responsive policies and practices.","Indicators for the NAP include a reduction in sexual and gender-based violence, increased participation of women and gender-diverse individuals in leadership roles, measurable improvements in the safety of peacebuilders and human rights defenders, and the implementation of flexible funding mechanisms for feminist movements.

The updated Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) framework focuses on fewer but more meaningful indicators, shifting from quantitative outputs to qualitative assessments that measure real impact and behavioral change.
This adaptive framework allows Canada to respond to emerging challenges and ensures that efforts are effectively supporting women, girls, and gender-diverse people in peace and security initiatives.","While specific budget details are not disclosed, the NAP emphasizes flexible funding models and resource commitments to support women'ss rights organizations and peacebuilders. Funding will be channeled through established mechanisms, including the Peace and Stabilization Operations Program (PSOPs) at Global Affairs Canada, which provides targeted support for women, peace, and security initiatives in fragile and conflict-affected contexts. Additionally, the Government of Canada is dedicating specific resources for coordinating the action plan. This includes funding for interdepartmental coordination, strengthening partnerships with civil society and Indigenous organizations, and supporting the monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) framework to ensure accountability and measure progress.","The NAP briefly references disarmament within its broader commitment to gender-sensitive security policies, specifically through approaches to arms control, mine action, and the inclusion of gender perspectives in security operations. However, disarmament is not a primary focus, appearing only once in the document.
Recognizing the critical role security and justice actors play in protecting civilians and preventing conflict, the NAP emphasizes the need to reform these sectors to address both historical and ongoing systemic harm. Central to this reform is the meaningful participation of women and gender-diverse people at all levels of decision-making and operations. Their inclusion strengthens responses to global security challenges, from arms control and mine action to emerging threats like climate security, cyber warfare, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks.","Human Rights Act: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

",3,North America,"Canada adopted its most recent National Action Plan NAP for the period 2023-2029. This is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2017 for the period 2017-2022 and in 2010 for the period 2010-2016. Compared to the 20172022 National Action Plan, the 20232029 Foundations for Peace introduces several changes that reflect both lessons learned and evolving global challenges. These include: Domestic Commitments: The 20232029 NAP includes more extensive domestic commitments than previous plans. These address emerging global issues that also have local impacts, such as the rise in climate emergencies and the increase in technology-facilitated gender-based violence. Notably, the plan specifically acknowledges threats targeting women peacebuilders and human rights defenders both in Canada and abroad. Deeper Engagement with Indigenous Communities: The NAP places greater emphasis on addressing gender-based discrimination, violence, oppression, and marginalization faced by women in Canada, particularly Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people. It recognizes that leadership by Indigenous women and gender-diverse individuals is essential for achieving sustainable peace and security for all. Integration of an Intersectional Feminist Approach: Building on insights from previous plans, the 20232029 NAP further develops an intersectional feminist framework. In 2017, Canada adopted a Feminist International Assistance Policy. The policy'ss core priority is identified as gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, with five additional supporting priorities: human dignity; growth that works for everyone; environment and climate action; inclusive governance; and peace and security. Canada is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Canada is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Canada was UN Women 'ss seventh-largest other resources contributor with USD 9.6 million and the tenth-largest total government contributor with USD 14.4 million. At the multilateral level, Canada was most recently a candidate for a non-permanent position at the United Nations Security Council for the period 2021-2022, but was not elected. Building and Sustaining Peace: Strengthen gender-responsive and gender-transformative approaches to building and sustaining peace in Canada and abroad. This includes supporting women and gender-diverse peacebuilders and human rights defenders through targeted funding and policy support. Security, Justice, and Accountability: Improve security, justice, and accountability systems to better respond to the needs of women, girls, and gender-diverse people. This involves reforming security institutions to be more inclusive and addressing systemic harm. Gender-Responsive Crisis Response: Ensure crisis responsesboth domestically and internationallyare gender-responsive. This includes integrating gender perspectives into disaster response, humanitarian aid, and peacekeeping operations. Prevention and Response to Sexual and Gender-Based Violence SGBV: Enhance efforts to prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence, particularly in conflict and post-conflict situations, and strengthen accountability mechanisms for perpetrators. Leadership and Capabilities: Strengthen Canada'ss leadership and capabilities to advance the WPS agenda. This involves building institutional capacity and leveraging Canada'ss position in international organizations to champion gender equality and peace initiatives. Inclusion: Promote meaningful inclusion of marginalized and underrepresented groups, particularly Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people, in peace and security efforts. The NAP integrates anti-racism, decolonization, and intersectionality across all focus areas. Key actions under the 20232029 National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security NAP include the establishment of a dedicated coordination hub at Global Affairs Canada to lead and oversee the implementation of the NAP across all partner departments and agencies. The plan prioritizes strengthening partnerships with civil society organizations, particularly Indigenous communities, women peacebuilders, and gender-diverse groups, to ensure their meaningful participation in peace and security decision-making at all levels. Additionally, the NAP commits to providing flexible and sustained funding to women'ss rights organizations and feminist movements, both domestically and internationally, recognizing their critical role in advancing peace and security. The Government of Canada will further integrate gender perspectives into all aspects of military operations, security sector reforms, and crisis response planning, ensuring that interventions are inclusive and responsive to diverse needs. The action plan also emphasizes building institutional capacity to address emerging global threatssuch as climate-related security risks, cybersecurity threats, and technology-facilitated gender-based violencethrough gender-responsive policies and practices.

32,Central African Republic,21,1,1,,,"The Central African Republic (CAR) adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2014-2016 and its second for the period 2019-2022. The second WPS NAP of the Central African Republic is based on a number of documents and policies relating to WPS and gender; these included the report of the implementation of the first WPS NAP, analysis of national and international legal instruments for the protection of women against gender-based violence, the study of the organizational structure and functioning modalities of the National Observatory on Equality between men and women, the proposals of some civil society and the network of parliamentarian women of Central African Republic, the diagnosis of the discrimination against women in CAR, and the study on the magnitude and forms of gender-based violence during crisis. Furthermore, the government of CAR collected data from key stakeholders who could participate in the implementation of the second action plan, including political-administrative authorities, pertinent services, leaders of the CSOs, Communitary Assistance Organizations (OACs) and feminist organizations. There are different challenges the government in CAR identified, including: The existence of discriminatory laws; Insufficient periodic reports on the implementation of international legal instruments; The persistence of insecurity in the country; Weak allocation of financial resources for the implementation of the NAP on UNSCR 1325; Lack of a grounded approach for gender-sensitive budgeting at the national and sectoral level; Lack of a national database of gender-based violence; Lack of a gender-sensitive Sectoral Strategy in the Defense and Security Forces; Insufficient synergy between the key stakeholders for the implementation of the NAP. The 2019-2022 CAR NAP has strategic axes that structure the document: Reinforcement of conflict prevention measures in order to avoid the emergence of violent conflicts and consolidation of peace; Full and meaningful participation and strong leadership of women in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security; Strengthening protection to promote and protect human rights, specifically those of women, in times of peace, in times of conflict, and at all stages of conflict resolution; Recovery and transitional justice so that the specific needs of women and girls are guaranteed in all reconstruction processes in conflict or post-conflict situations, with particular attention to the most vulnerable (displaced and/or refugee women and girls, survivors of gender-based violence, women and girls with disabilities); Strengthening protection and security in the face of new human security threats. The Central African Republic reported on its WPS implementation in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). The Central African Republic gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule. The most recent armed conflict in the history of the CAR is its ongoing civil war, which started in 2012. The conflict has displaced thousands of people and left millions in need of humanitarian aid. In 2014, the UN Security Council established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic ( MINUSCA ) to ensure peace and stability in the country. Nevertheless, there have been several allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers in the CAR.",1991,,2015,43.2M,"Development
The government of the Central African Republic presented the first draft of the second NAP, finalizing and approving it under the leadership of the Ministry for the Promotion of Women, of the Family, and the Protection of the Child, with the financial and technical support of UN Women.
Implementation
The Ministry for the Promotion of Women, of the Family, and the Protection of the Child is responsible for the coordination of the implementation of the NAP, in partnership with UN Women, and in collaboration with other UN agencies including international NGOs working on the WPS agenda. The Action Plan recommends the creation of a Technical Secretariat to support the implementation.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The monitoring and evaluation of the NAP will be made by a Technical Committee, composed of:
The National Technical Comittee for the fight against gender-based violence, harmful traditional practices and child marriage
The Equality Observatory
The Local Committees for Peace
The National Forum recommendation follow-up committee
The National Mediation Council
The Commission for Truth, Justice, Reparation and Reconciliation
Local focal points
Civil Society
The National Action Plan notes the role CSOs play in the implementation of the NAP, and identifies a need to collaborate with all organizations working with the WPS agenda. The NAP intends to train and help CSOs to develop leadership and increase women'ss participation in all levels of political life, and sees them as a key source for data and information.",The timeframe for the NAP is 2019-2022.,"The main objective of the NAP is to reinforce the participation of women at all levels of decision making, especially regarding the prevention, the management and resolution of conflicts and peace consolidation.
 The second objective is to ensure the participation of women and the introduction of their rights and specific needs in conflict and post-conflict situations through peace consolidation and economic recovery programs.
 Moreover, each axis has an objective as well:
Create measures for conflict prevention in post-conflict situations.
Promote the significant participation and involvement of women in all conflict resolution, peace consolidation and security efforts.
Promote and protect women'ss rights, with an emphasis on the prevention of gender-based violence.
Guarantee that women and girls's specific needs are considered during the reconstruction of the country, with attention to the most vulnerable groups.
Ensure protection of women and girls during epidemics, natural disasters and terrorist threats.","All the actions on the Central African Action Plan are structured around the axes of the document. Examples of the enlisted actions are below.
1.1 Sensitize the members of the Government and national top executives on UNSCR 1325 and national and international legal instruments on human rights, as well as on the need to promote policies that reinforce the protection of women and girls.
1.5 Promote dialogue among all the signatories of the Peace and Reconciliation Accords by calling on them to put an end to violence in all forms.
2.2 Review discriminatory laws that prevent the promotion of women'ss rights.
2.11 Train women leaders on conflict resolution, mediation and peace consolidation.
3.6 Ensure the implementation of holistic care for women and girls, and men and boys who are survivors of sexual violence.
4.3 Implement a reparations system for victims of sexual and gender-based violence during conflict.
5.6 Include women in the fight against climate change","Indicators depend upon the objectives of the axis, establishing expected outcomes.
UNSCR 1325 and international and national texts regarding human rights as well as the protection of women and girls are known among 60% of the community and are sufficiently implemented by key stakeholders.
Women'ss participation in decision-making at all levels in conflict prevention, resolution, and security governance are significantly increased with tangible results.
Concrete measures are implemented for the promotion and protection of women'ss rights.
The specific needs of women are considered in post-conflict reconstruction, and in conflict and post conflict situations, with particular attention to the most vulnerable (women and girls internally displaced, with a disability, survivors of GBV, etc.)
Women and girls are better protected and supported during emerging epidemics, natural disasters, climate change, and terrorist threats.
Likewise, the NAP includes indicators for each activity enlisted. These include:
1.1.1 Number of sensitization sessions in Bangui in 2019 and 2020
1.1.4 Percentage of the state and the communes's budgets earmarked for gender issues in 2019 and 2020
1.4.1 150 Local authorities trained in 16 prefectures in 2019 and 2020
2.2.1 Number of women in decision-making in the administration and within institutions","The NAP recommends the creation of a Monitoring and Evaluation plan to define the references, indicators, techniques and means to collect data. It also includes a matrix for this process, where the objectives, strategies, specific actions, indicators, means of verification, data collection methods, frequency of the reports and responsible individuals or institutions. No further information is included.","The NAP identifies that CFA 4,400,000,000 (Approx. USD 7,400,000) will be needed for the full implementation of the Plan. The Ministry for the Promotion of the Women, of the Family, and the Protection of the Child is responsible for advocating for financing for the NAP in the national budget and mobilizing internal resources. Additionally, the working group for the NAP will collaborate with the technical and financial partners to identify the available and potential sources of financing for the implementation of the NAP. Furthermore, UNFPA AND UN Women will support the Ministry to organize biannual advocacy meetings with senior officials of banking institutions, heads of commercial institutions, NGO leaders and majors to ensure support for the NAP.","Throughout the document, there is a recurrent recognition of the role women play regarding disarmament, particularly through DDR processes. Further, in axis 5, the NAP discusses Regulation 01/CEMAC/UMAC/CM of April 11, 2016 on the prevention and repression of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and arms proliferation.

The second WPS NAP of the Central African Republic is based on a number of documents and policies relating to WPS and gender; these included the report of the implementation of the first WPS NAP, analysis of national and international legal instruments for the protection of women against gender-based violence, the study of the organizational structure and functioning modalities of the National Observatory on Equality between men and women, the proposals of some civil society and the network of parliamentarian women of Central African Republic, the diagnosis of the discrimination against women in CAR, and the study on the magnitude and forms of gender-based violence during crisis. Furthermore, the government of CAR collected data from key stakeholders who could participate in the implementation of the second action plan, including political-administrative authorities, pertinent services, leaders of the CSOs, Communitary Assistance Organizations OACs and feminist organizations. There are different challenges the government in CAR identified, including: The existence of discriminatory laws; Insufficient periodic reports on the implementation of international legal instruments; The persistence of insecurity in the country; Weak allocation of financial resources for the implementation of the NAP on UNSCR 1325; Lack of a grounded approach for gender-sensitive budgeting at the national and sectoral level; Lack of a national database of gender-based violence; Lack of a gender-sensitive Sectoral Strategy in the Defense and Security Forces; Insufficient synergy between the key stakeholders for the implementation of the NAP. The 2019-2022 CAR NAP has strategic axes that structure the document: Reinforcement of conflict prevention measures in order to avoid the emergence of violent conflicts and consolidation of peace; Full and meaningful participation and strong leadership of women in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security; Strengthening protection to promote and protect human rights, specifically those of women, in times of peace, in times of conflict, and at all stages of conflict resolution; Recovery and transitional justice so that the specific needs of women and girls are guaranteed in all reconstruction processes in conflict or post-conflict situations, with particular attention to the most vulnerable displaced andor refugee women and girls, survivors of gender-based violence, women and girls with disabilities; Strengthening protection and security in the face of new human security threats. The Central African Republic reported on its WPS implementation in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. The Central African Republic gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule. The most recent armed conflict in the history of the CAR is its ongoing civil war, which started in 2012. The conflict has displaced thousands of people and left millions in need of humanitarian aid. In 2014, the UN Security Council established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic  MINUSCA  to ensure peace and stability in the country. Nevertheless, there have been several allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers in the CAR. The main objective of the NAP is to reinforce the participation of women at all levels of decision making, especially regarding the prevention, the management and resolution of conflicts and peace consolidation. The second objective is to ensure the participation of women and the introduction of their rights and specific needs in conflict and post-conflict situations through peace consolidation and economic recovery programs. Moreover, each axis has an objective as well: Create measures for conflict prevention in post-conflict situations. Promote the significant participation and involvement of women in all conflict resolution, peace consolidation and security efforts. Promote and protect women'ss rights, with an emphasis on the prevention of gender-based violence. Guarantee that women and girls's specific needs are considered during the reconstruction of the country, with attention to the most vulnerable groups. Ensure protection of women and girls during epidemics, natural disasters and terrorist threats. All the actions on the Central African Action Plan are structured around the axes of the document. Examples of the enlisted actions are below. 1.1 Sensitize the members of the Government and national top executives on UNSCR 1325 and national and international legal instruments on human rights, as well as on the need to promote policies that reinforce the protection of women and girls. 1.5 Promote dialogue among all the signatories of the Peace and Reconciliation Accords by calling on them to put an end to violence in all forms. 2.2 Review discriminatory laws that prevent the promotion of women'ss rights. 2.11 Train women leaders on conflict resolution, mediation and peace consolidation. 3.6 Ensure the implementation of holistic care for women and girls, and men and boys who are survivors of sexual violence. 4.3 Implement a reparations system for victims of sexual and gender-based violence during conflict. 5.6 Include women in the fight against climate change Indicators depend upon the objectives of the axis, establishing expected outcomes. UNSCR 1325 and international and national texts regarding human rights as well as the protection of women and girls are known among 60 of the community and are sufficiently implemented by key stakeholders. Women'ss participation in decision-making at all levels in conflict prevention, resolution, and security governance are significantly increased with tangible results. Concrete measures are implemented for the promotion and protection of women'ss rights. The specific needs of women are considered in post-conflict reconstruction, and in conflict and post conflict situations, with particular attention to the most vulnerable women and girls internally displaced, with a disability, survivors of GBV, etc. Women and girls are better protected and supported during emerging epidemics, natural disasters, climate change, and terrorist threats. Likewise, the NAP includes indicators for each activity enlisted. These include: 1.1.1 Number of sensitization sessions in Bangui in 2019 and 2020 1.1.4 Percentage of the state and the communes's budgets earmarked for gender issues in 2019 and 2020 1.4.1 150 Local authorities trained in 16 prefectures in 2019 and 2020 2.2.1 Number of women in decision-making in the administration and within institutions The NAP recommends the creation of a Monitoring and Evaluation plan to define the references, indicators, techniques and means to collect data. It also includes a matrix for this process, where the objectives, strategies, specific actions, indicators, means of verification, data collection methods, frequency of the reports and responsible individuals or institutions. No further information is included. The NAP identifies that CFA 4,400,000,000 Approx. USD 7,400,000 will be needed for the full implementation of the Plan. The Ministry for the Promotion of the Women, of the Family, and the Protection of the Child is responsible for advocating for financing for the NAP in the national budget and mobilizing internal resources. Additionally, the working group for the NAP will collaborate with the technical and financial partners to identify the available and potential sources of financing for the implementation of the NAP. Furthermore, UNFPA AND UN Women will support the Ministry to organize biannual advocacy meetings with senior officials of banking institutions, heads of commercial institutions, NGO leaders and majors to ensure support for the NAP. Throughout the document, there is a recurrent recognition of the role women play regarding disarmament, particularly through DDR processes. Further, in axis 5, the NAP discusses Regulation 01CEMACUMACCM of April 11, 2016 on the prevention and repression of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and arms proliferation."

34,Chile,6,1,0,,,"Chile adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015 for the period 2015-2018. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ministry of National Defense, and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity in consultation with civil society organizations. The NAP identifies its objectives based on the primary pillars of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda and seeks to incorporate a gender perspective across all activities; promote women'ss meaningful participation in peace negotiations; protect the wellbeing of women and girls; and increase women'ss access to recovery aid based on specific needs. The NAP is focused on national efforts to increase the roles of women in decision-making positions related to conflict prevention and overall gender mainstreaming. The includes indicators and a monitoring framework to evaluate implementation. The NAP does not include an allocated budget, and instead states that each coordinating institution is responsible for financing the identified activities through their annual budget. Chile'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP adopted in 2009, without a specific timeframe of implementation. One of the objectives of the first NAP is ""to consider Resolution 1325 as a general Chilean foreign policy objective, and incorporate its requirements into bilateral and multilateral activities” (p. 16). As such, the NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly internationally, focusing on conflict and post-conflict contexts as well as gender mainstreaming in peace and conflict matters, increasing women'ss representation in overseas peacekeeping missions. In comparison to its first NAP, Chile'ss second NAP has clearer indicators to monitor and assess if identified goals are reached. This revision was the result of a review conducted to assess the implementation of the first NAP, which found out that there was a need to create a more flexible and measurable action plan. Despite the improvements of its monitoring and evaluation framework, the updated NAP is similar in terms of its objectives, continuing to interpret WPS implementation mostly internationally. Chile does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but experienced a military coup in 1973, with subsequent military rule under Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1990. The period of military dictatorship resulted in severe human rights violations, including forced disappearances , especially against the critics of the political regime. In 2019, Chile experienced country-wide protests emanating from the social and economic inequalities remnant of the Pinochet era. The protests resulted in a referendum that took place in 2020, with an overwhelming majority voting in favor of a new constitution. Feminist activists played a pivotal role leading up to the referandum, popularizing the slogans ""never again without women” and ""we are half, we want half” to demand that women hold equal representation in the constitutional convention. At the multilateral level, Chile most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015.",1989,57,2018,5B,"NAP Development
Certain non-governmental institutions  were included in the development of the NAP such as the National Institute for Human Rights, the Center for Human Rights (University of Chile) and the Regional Center for Human Rights. The updated NAP also claims to incorporate CSO recommendations; however, it is not explicitly mentioned which recommendations have been acted upon and which CSOs have submitted these recommendations. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Chile and therefore was not involved in the development process of Chile'ss NAP.
The NAP was developed mainly by the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ministry of National Defense, and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity. Other actors were involved such as the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Interior, the National Academy of Political and Strategic Studies, the Joint Center for Peace Operations of Chile
NAP Implementation
Chile's NAP does not outline any CSO involvement in the implementation phase.
For the implementation of the NAP, the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity formed part of the implementation of the NAP
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Unlike the previous NAP, this NAP specifies the roles of CSO in the monitoring  and evaluation of certain objectives related to the involvement of civil society. For example, for the objective ""promoting the inclusion of  a gender perspective in all activities related to the construction, maintenance and consolidation of peace”, civil society organisations along with the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Women and Gender Equity and the Ministry of Foreign affairs will be responsible for  monitoring and evaluating the development and dissemination of standards of conduct to prevent the violation of the rights of women and girls in the development of peace operations.
The NAP will be monitored and evaluated annually by an Inter Ministerial committee made up of representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity.",The second NAP has been implemented for a period of four years 2015-2018.,"The main objectives of this second NAP is to implement four pillars of the WPS Agenda: prevention, participation, protection, relief and recovery. 
Prevention consists of incorporating a gender perspective in all activities and strategies aimed at preventing conflict and maintaining peace. This theme also focuses on the creation of mechanisms and effective institutions that will ensure a gender perspective in any efforts to prevent violence against women and girls. 
Participation consists of promoting and supporting the meaningful participation of women in all parts of peace processes and ensuring their representation in all levels of decision-making related to prevention and ending of conflict. It also includes strengthening the relationships between national and international organisations of women'ss rights defenders. 
Protection focuses on strengthening and amplifying the measures taken to guarantee security, physical and mental integrity, sexual and reproductive health, well being, economic autonomy and the dignity of women and girls.  This aims to respect and guarantee the full exercise of the human rights of women and girls, while incorporating a gender perspective in the institutions that play a role in peace, conflict and post-conflict operations.
Relief and recovery pertains to the promotion of equal access for women to mechanisms and services for the distribution of aid, particularly those related to the specific needs of women and girls in all recovery efforts, such as during the transition of justice.",," Each objective of the NAP includes a system of indicators that serve to verify and control the implementation of each objectives in a foreseeable timeframe. For example, for the first objective related to prevention, more specifically, ""Promote the inclusion of perspective of gender in all the activities of construction, maintenance and consolidation Peace”, the indicators are: - Number of thematic units training about gender, UNSCR 1325 as a system, International Instruments of Human Rights and/or International Humanitarian Law - Number of trainings  made on gender perspective in the pre-deployment and post-deployment
 ","The NAP will be monitored and evaluated annually by an Inter Ministerial committee made up of representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity.","Each coordinating institution must include in its annual budget an item destined to the financing of the activities that correspond to them according to the objectives of this NAP. Likewise, it is recommended to consider the aforementioned item to the participating institutions.",There is no mention of disarmament in the updated NAP.,"Servicio Nacional De La Mujer Sernam: Institutional mechanisms

",3,Latin America & Caribbean,"Chile adopted its most recent National Action Plan NAP in 2015 for the period 2015-2018. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ministry of National Defense, and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity in consultation with civil society organizations. The NAP identifies its objectives based on the primary pillars of the Women, Peace, and Security WPS Agenda and seeks to incorporate a gender perspective across all activities; promote women'ss meaningful participation in peace negotiations; protect the wellbeing of women and girls; and increase women'ss access to recovery aid based on specific needs. The NAP is focused on national efforts to increase the roles of women in decision-making positions related to conflict prevention and overall gender mainstreaming. The includes indicators and a monitoring framework to evaluate implementation. The NAP does not include an allocated budget, and instead states that each coordinating institution is responsible for financing the identified activities through their annual budget. Chile'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP adopted in 2009, without a specific timeframe of implementation. One of the objectives of the first NAP is ""to consider Resolution 1325 as a general Chilean foreign policy objective, and incorporate its requirements into bilateral and multilateral activities p. 16. As such, the NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly internationally, focusing on conflict and post-conflict contexts as well as gender mainstreaming in peace and conflict matters, increasing women'ss representation in overseas peacekeeping missions. In comparison to its first NAP, Chile'ss second NAP has clearer indicators to monitor and assess if identified goals are reached. This revision was the result of a review conducted to assess the implementation of the first NAP, which found out that there was a need to create a more flexible and measurable action plan. Despite the improvements of its monitoring and evaluation framework, the updated NAP is similar in terms of its objectives, continuing to interpret WPS implementation mostly internationally. Chile does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but experienced a military coup in 1973, with subsequent military rule under Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1990. The period of military dictatorship resulted in severe human rights violations, including forced disappearances , especially against the critics of the political regime. In 2019, Chile experienced country-wide protests emanating from the social and economic inequalities remnant of the Pinochet era. The protests resulted in a referendum that took place in 2020, with an overwhelming majority voting in favor of a new constitution. Feminist activists played a pivotal role leading up to the referandum, popularizing the slogans ""never again without women and ""we are half, we want half to demand that women hold equal representation in the constitutional convention. At the multilateral level, Chile most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015. The main objectives of this second NAP is to implement four pillars of the WPS Agenda: prevention, participation, protection, relief and recovery. Prevention consists of incorporating a gender perspective in all activities and strategies aimed at preventing conflict and maintaining peace. This theme also focuses on the creation of mechanisms and effective institutions that will ensure a gender perspective in any efforts to prevent violence against women and girls. Participation consists of promoting and supporting the meaningful participation of women in all parts of peace processes and ensuring their representation in all levels of decision-making related to prevention and ending of conflict. It also includes strengthening the relationships between national and international organisations of women'ss rights defenders. Protection focuses on strengthening and amplifying the measures taken to guarantee security, physical and mental integrity, sexual and reproductive health, well being, economic autonomy and the dignity of women and girls. This aims to respect and guarantee the full exercise of the human rights of women and girls, while incorporating a gender perspective in the institutions that play a role in peace, conflict and post-conflict operations. Relief and recovery pertains to the promotion of equal access for women to mechanisms and services for the distribution of aid, particularly those related to the specific needs of women and girls in all recovery efforts, such as during the transition of justice. Each objective of the NAP includes a system of indicators that serve to verify and control the implementation of each objectives in a foreseeable timeframe. For example, for the first objective related to prevention, more specifically, ""Promote the inclusion of perspective of gender in all the activities of construction, maintenance and consolidation Peace, the indicators are: - Number of thematic units training about gender, UNSCR 1325 as a system, International Instruments of Human Rights andor International Humanitarian Law - Number of trainings made on gender perspective in the pre-deployment and post-deployment The NAP will be monitored and evaluated annually by an Inter Ministerial committee made up of representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity. Each coordinating institution must include in its annual budget an item destined to the financing of the activities that correspond to them according to the objectives of this NAP. Likewise, it is recommended to consider the aforementioned item to the participating institutions. There is no mention of disarmament in the updated NAP."

Croatia'ss Second National Action Plan for Women, Peace, and Security was developed by the Government of the Republic of Croatia in collaboration with a Working Group that was specifically tasked with developing the plan. Croatia'ss second NAP, NAP II, mimics the structure of NAP I in its objective and measures in the areas of prevention, participation and protection, and post-conflict recovery; however it also identifies new priorities in strengthening implementation and monitoring. NAP II'ss development considers new Security Council resolutions on women, peace, and security that address challenges such as climate, migration, and terrorism (p. 7). The Working Group, chaired by the assistant minister for Multilateral Global Issues, operates under the guidance of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs. Croatia'ss Working Group membership includes appointed representatives of sectoral bodies and the representatives of the Office of the President of the Republic of Croatia and those of the Ombudsman for Gender Equality (p.7). Croatia'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2011 and implemented for the period 2011-2014. The NAP was developed by an interdepartmental working group coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration. Civil society actors were invited to provide input to the drafted NAP, but had no representation in the Working Group that was responsible for the NAP'ss development. The NAP identifies nine strategic objectives, grouped under thematic pillars: prevention; participation; protection and post-conflict recovery; and implementation and monitoring. These objectives include increasing women'ss representation in decision-making processes related to peace and security; promoting and protecting the rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict settings; and improving cooperation in implementing Resolution 1325, among others. Croatia reported on the implementation of its NAP, the development of the second NAP, and other WPS commitments in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Croatia declared and gained independence in 1991 and 1995, respectively, followed by an independence war (1991-1995) that took place between the Croat forces and Serbian Yugoslav People'ss Army. The conflict contained numerous human rights violations, including indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas, ethnic cleansing, and sexual violence used as a weapon of war. The conflict led to the death and displacement of thousands of people. During the war, women played a key role in antimilitarist and humanitarian efforts, including establishing anti-war groups, operating hotlines for victims of the war, and setting up women'ss shelters. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established in 1993 to prosecute crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars, including those in Croatia. In 2015, the Croatian parliament passed a law that recognized the rights of victims of sexual violence during the war, which will provide survivors with a monthly stipend as well as access to free counseling and legal and medical aid. At the multilateral level, Croatia most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2008-2009.",1992,60,2014,1.009B,"NAP Development 
On 18 January 2018, the Government of the Republic of Croatia adopted the ""Decision on the establishment of a Working Group for developing the NAP for Implementing Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on WPS and related Resolutions”. Croatia'ss Second National Action Plan for Women, Peace, and Security (2019-2023) was developed by the Government of the Republic of Croatia in collaboration with this Working Group. Croatia'ss second NAP, NAP II, mimics the structure of NAP I in its objective and measures in the areas of prevention, participation and protection, and post-conflict recovery; however it also identifies new priorities in strengthening implementation and monitoring. NAP II'ss development considers new Security Council resolutions on women, peace, and security that address challenges such as climate, migration, and terrorism (p. 7). The Working Group, chaired by the assistant minister for Multilateral Global Issues, operates under the guidance of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs. Croatia'ss Working Group membership includes appointed representatives of sectoral bodies and the representatives of the Office of the President of the Republic of Croatia and those of the Ombudsman for Gender Equality (p.7). The National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security does not explicitly mention civil society in its development, however, the NAP states that civil society groups and organizations were invited to collaborate with facilitators of relevant measures within different objectives (p. 12-18). During the consultation process, between December 2019 and January 2019, the NAP states that interested groups and stakeholders had the opportunity to express opinions and proposals.
NAP Implementation
The implementation and monitoring of NAP II was conducted by the Working Group, which will assemble as needed, at least once a year to review the annual report on implementation of NAP measures. The Working Group will submit, to the Croatian Government, a biannual report on the implementation of NAP measures and information on implementation will be provided upon request to relevant international organisations (p.20). 
At the national level, emphasis has been placed on strengthening interest and improving capacities of institutions involved as well as other stakeholders, including the wider Croatian public, so that a comprehensive gender-sensitive approach to security can be implemented (p.8). Special emphasis has been placed on measures pertaining to education and training, especially in areas of prevention (p.8). In regard to foreign policy, the Republic of Croatia will continue active engagement within the framework of the Group of Friends of UNSCR 1325 and encourage the implementation of gender-sensitive foreign, security, defense, and development policy in accordance with membership commitments from the EU and NATO (p.8).  
Implementation measures have been divided into the following categories:
Prevention - measures will be implemented and aimed at strengthening gender perspectives through (i) documents, international activities and communicating with public and (ii) education and training programs. 
Participation - (i) introducing gender balance in the activities of the security and defense sector and (ii) increase representation of women in decision-making activities and processes concerning peacebuilding and security (p. 8) 
Protection and post-conflict recovery - (i) implement protection of women and girls's rights - war victims in the Republic of Croatia with a view to their post-conflict recovery with the measures modified to a lesser extent. (p.8) 
Two other objectives were focused on external action (ii) promotion of the protection of the rights of women and girls - victims of gender-based violence in the areas of armed conflict and (iii) orienting developmental cooperation towards protection and empowerment of women in accordance with the National Development Cooperation Strategy (2017-2021) (p.9) 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The Working Group is tasked with analysing and evaluating the results of the implementation of NAP I measures and drafting the proposal of the new National Action Plan. The Working Group has two objectives regarding (i) the improvement of cooperation in implementing UNSRs on WPS and (ii) monitoring the implementation of UNSCRs. These objectives are strengthened through consistent monitoring measures and through regular reporting to the Government of the Republic of Croatia (p.9). A description of measures for implementation and monitoring are included in pages 18 -20 of the NAP. ",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2019-2023.,"Croatia'ss second National Action Plan contains a new chapter - Security Risk Management - which introduces two new objectives: (i) gender-sensitive approach in managing security risks of natural and technological disasters and terrorism and (ii) promoting protection of women and girl refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, with measures elaborated within each of the two objectives (p.9) 
Implementation and monitoring contain two objectives: (i) improvement of cooperation in implementing UNSCRs on WPS and (ii) monitoring the implementation of UNSCRs. (p.9)
Both objectives are strengthened through additional measures, especially in relations to the local level of implementation and more consistent monitoring of measures within the framework of the Working Group, as well as regular reporting to the Government of the Republic of Croatia on the results (p.9)

46,Denmark,3,1,1,,31.9,"Denmark adopted its fourth National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2024. The main inter-ministerial working group for the NAP is composed of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, the Danish Ministry of Defence, the Danish Ministry of Justice (the Danish National Police). All of these ministries will also develop implementation plans for the NAP. The NAP states that Denmark will invite all interested civil society actors to participate in NAP implementation, and this will be coordinated in the annual forum and through thematic working groups that will be developed. The overall goal of Denmark'ss new action plan is to ensure the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in peace efforts (from prevention and conflict management, to peacebuilding and sustaining peace), and to incorporate the consideration of women and men'ss equality, rights, interests, vulnerabilities and needs into all aspects of the work for sustainable peace. Several countries/regions are specifically highlighted in the NAP: Iraq, the Sahel region, Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia. Denmark'ss fourth NAP is preceded by three other NAPs, adopted in 2005, 2008, and 2014 and implemented for the period 2005-2007, 2008-2013, and 2014-2019, respectively. Denmark'ss second and third NAPs are significantly longer and more substantive than its first NAP. Furthermore, both the second and third NAPs have standalone sections dedicated to providing an overview of the ""lessons learned” from the implementation of the previous NAPs. While the first NAP does not specifically identify actors involved in the development, implementation, and monitoring of the NAP, the second NAP places particular importance on the role of civil society and nongovernmental organizations in the implementation of the NAP. In particular, the NAP states that ""broad national ownership of the revised NAP has been achieved through a substantial consultative process” (p. 33). Furthermore, the third NAP identifies working with women'ss organizations ""to ensure women'ss representation in (i) peace and state building processes at community, regional and national levels and (ii) political, democracy and civil society processes and institutions” (p. 11) as a primary goal. Denmark reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Denmark does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but is involved in overseas military operations, international peacekeeping, and humanitarian missions. In 2019, Denmark extended the suspension of its arms exports to include the United Arab Emirates, in addition to Saudi Arabia. Denmark is a major contributor to humanitarian aid, with Danish NGOs playing an active mission in the country'ss humanitarian assistance framework. Denmark is a member of the Nordic Women Mediators Network, which was launched in 2015. Denmark is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Denmark most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2005-2006.",1983,14,2014,4.5B,"The fourth Danish National Action Plan will be implemented for the period 2020-2024. The main working group for the NAP is composed of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, the Danish Ministry of Defence, the Danish Ministry of Justice (the Danish National Police). All of these ministries will also develop implementation plans for the NAP. 
Civil Society
The NAP states that these ministries will coordinate with civil society, and will hold an annual forum to discuss the NAP. Per the evaluation of the previous NAP, Denmark found that there was a need to increase competency on the WPS agenda within ministries, in order to better implement and follow up on the NAP (pg. 32). As a result, actors will undergo joint training and coordination. 
The NAP states that Denmark will invite all interested civil society actors to participate in NAP implementation, and this will be coordinated in the annual forum and through thematic working groups that will be developed (pg. 11).  It states that ""the aim and purpose of these working groups will be established in collaboration with civil society, and the implementation plans for ministries should be the starting point for these discussions.”
Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP states that the plan will be regularly re-assessed. This fourth NAP was developed based on the evaluation of the third NAP. There will be an annual evaluation of the NAP and adaptation of its goals and priorities according to this evaluation. This will be conducted in the format of an annual forum.
WILPF Denmark advocated for this fourth Danish NAP to be feminist and peace-oriented, and were part of a consortium of Danish NGOs, researchers, and other organisations advocating for peace within the NAP. They will continue to participate in this consortium and will monitor the implementation of the NAP. ",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2020-2024.,"The overall goal of Denmark'ss new action plan is to ensure the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in peace efforts (from prevention and conflict management, to peacebuilding and sustaining peace), and to incorporate the consideration of women and men'ss equality, rights, interests, vulnera- bilities and needs into all aspects of the work for sustainable peace. Several countries/regions are specifically highlighted in the NAP: Iraq, the Sahel region, Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia.
There are three main pillars of the NAP: Denmark as a security policy actor; Women'ss participation in peace and security; and Sexual and gender-based violence in conflict situations and efforts against sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment. Under each of these pillars there are goals identified. ","There is a results framework which lays out specific actions and activities under the three main goals. Furthermore, the NAP identifies that there will be specific implementation plans for each of the relevant ministries [the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, the Danish Ministry of Defence, and the Danish Ministry of Justice (the Danish National Police)]. 
Under Goal 1, there are two sub-goals: Goal 1.1: A stronger gender perspective in international operations, missions and peace and stabilisation efforts, and Goal 1.2: A stronger Danish voice in multilateral security policy cooperation for the benefit of women, peace and security. Under Goal 1.1 there is a case study on Denmark'ss work on Iraq, and under Goal 1.2, which focuses on NATO, the EU, and the UN, there is a case study on the Sahel region.
Under Goal 2, there are two sub-goals: Goal 2.1: Strengthen women'ss participation in global peace and security efforts, and Goal 2.2: Strengthen Danish women'ss participation in peace and security efforts. Goal 2.1 has a case study on Afghanistan and identifies that Nordic cooperation and support for Danish NGOs and women'ss networks will be some priorities.
Under Goal 3, there are two sub-goals: Goal 3.1: Prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence in conflict situations and fragile contexts and Goal 3.2: Zero tolerance for sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment among our partners and in Danish ranks. Work on Syria and Somalia is specifically highlighted, as is the Danish commitment to sexual and reproductive health and rights.","There are a number of outcomes indicated under the different goals and objectives identified above, within the results framework. More specific indicators will be identified in the implementation plan.  
Examples of outcomes under goal 2 include: 
2.1.1. Denmark has contributed to eliminating fundamental barriers to the participation of women by contributing to increased security for women and girls in conflict areas and fragile contexts.
2.1.2. Denmark has promoted the participation and engagement of women in peace and security efforts, political decision-making processes and local issues in the areas where Denmark is present, and has strengthened the dialogue with local women actors at all levels. ","The National Action Plan articulates that it has been developed based on the findings of the evaluation of the Third NAP. It found that "" the last two action plans had only made limited contributions to concrete results in Denmark'ss partner countries, and that the resolution had slipped out of view in Danish strategies and country programmes.”
The previously mentioned 2019 evaluation of the two most recent Danish WPS action plans concluded that there was a need for increased competency; a sense of fatigue on gender equality; and that there was insufficient incorporation of civil society. 
The NAP states that there will be ""Ongoing follow-up, annual evaluation and agile adaptation of the action plan and respective implementation plans will ensure that the plan leads to tangible results for women and girls living in crisis and conflict areas, and thereby for the societies where Denmark is actively involved” (pg.11).","The NAP does not specifically reference a budget, although one section speaks about the Peace and Stabilisation Fund, which primarily finances Denmark'ss efforts for peacebuilding and stabilisation. Page 14 states that the fund will increasingly focus on strengthening WPS, and that future evaluations and programmes of the fund will assess how activities can incorporate gender perspectives and make an impact on the ground. ","The NAP calls for the need to mainstream gender within disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) processes but otherwise does not reference disarmament or recognize the negative impacts of weapons on women'ss security.","24/7 Hotline for Violence against Women: Services > Social services > Hotline Helpline

47,Djibouti,,1,1,,,,1998,,2013,,"The Ministry of Women and Family (MFF) is the government institution responsible for the NAP at all stages.
Development
The development of the Action Plan proceeded in three stages:
Research and documentary analyses were carried out, as well as qualitative interviews with key institutions and organizations regarding the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda.
A workshop on the NAP draft was held, in which participants of related institutions discussed, amended, and made proposals to finalize the document.
The final stage was the launching of the NAP as a whole.
Implementation
Although the Ministry of Women and Family is the main initiator of the NAP, the document recognizes that the implementation is a shared responsibility among all the institutions cited in the Action Plan, to ensure that all programmed actions and activities are realized within the timeframe.
The participants in the implementation process include the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Ministry of Justice, the National Commission of Human Rights, the Center of Studies and Research of Djibouti, the National Union of Djiboutian Women (UNFD), the National Assembly, The University of Djibouti,  feminist associations, non-governmental organizations, and others.
Monitoring and Evaluation

These include amendments to laws and government institutions, studies, sensibilization campaigns, training and workshops, capacity-building measures for public institutions and civil society organizations, etc. Examples of these under the first strategic objective include:
Organize awareness and information campaigns on UNSCR 1325 among the population in general and women in particular.
Increase the participation of Djiboutian women in peacekeeping operations from the UN and the African Union

Examples of the indicators for the actions proposed under the first strategic objective include:
The number of campaigns and number of participants in the UNSCR 1325 awareness and information campaigns.
The number and percentage of women participating in peacekeeping operations

52,El Salvador,6,1,1,,,"El Salvador adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2022 and its most recent for the period 2022-2024. Analysis is forthcoming. The 2017-2022 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women, and the Implementation Committee and its Technical Monitoring Committee. These entities were tasked with convening with UN Women, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Spanish Agency for International Development and Cooperation, the Central American Integration System, and the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy as well as consulting with the Government of Chile. The NAP aims to strengthen women'ss participation in all decision-making levels of peace processes; creating a culture of zero-tolerance for violence against women; offering protections and basic services to women and girls; increasing reparations for women and girl victims of armed conflict; and strengthening the monitoring of the implementation of Resolution 1325. The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that includes actions, indicators, responsible entities, legal frames of reference, and a timeframe. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. El Salvador reported on the implementation of its NAP and the WPS Agenda in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (p. 50): The governmental and civil society institutions that make up the National Committee for the Implementation of the National Action Plan have carried out important actions in order to comply with the Plan, among them: Training and sensitization programs on Resolution 1325 have been implemented, directed to the personnel of the Armed Forces of El Salvador, as well as to the personnel who are in the process of Education and Training, to participate in Peacekeeping Operations Missions of the United Nations. Creation of the Network of Women Human Rights Defenders of Women working in the PNC. This is a mechanism to guarantee, defend and promote the rights of women working within the Police Corporation. The Network aims to guarantee and accompany the processes of care for women working in the institution, including students of the National Academy of Public Security, who are doing police internships in the PNC. Health care for women war veterans and women victims of serious human rights violations. Promotion of psychosocial support groups for women veterans and victims of war. There is a draft document of the Psychosocial Care Manual, which has been consulted with different organizations and experts and is in the process of being formalized. The most recent armed conflict in El Salvador'ss history is the civil war, which took place between 1980 and 1992. The country signed a peace agreement known as the Chapultepec Peace Accords in 1992, which outlined a comprehensive reconstruction plan based on widespread reforms. Women constituted 13% of negotiators and 12% of signatories; nevertheless, the peace agreement did not include any provisions on protecting and promoting women'ss rights.",1981,80,2014,320M,"NAP Development
The NAP highlights the involvement of the Salvadoran Institute for Women'ss Development through the UNSCR1325 Implementation Committee and its Technical Monitoring Committee. The Salvadoran Institute for Women'ss Development worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to create the NAP, specifically on women'ss rights issues.
The NAP notes the role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the development of the NAP.  The Government of Chile also played an integral role in funding and creating the NAP alongside the Salvadoran Government.  
NAP Implementation
This NAP recognises the partnership of Government entities and civil society throughout the implementation of the NAP. The Salvadoran Institute for Women'ss Development will work on implementing the components of the NAP pertaining to the protection of women and girls.
The framework for implementation of the NAP comprises of several parts because of the different pillars.   Different bodies are in charge of the implementation of different objectives.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Representatives from civil society will form part of the monitoring and evaluation team through the Implementation Committee of Resolution 1325 and its Technical Monitoring Committee.
Government entities will form part of the monitoring and evaluation team through providing reports periodically and ultimately when the NAP ends. For instance, for the pillar pertaining to including women in security issues, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security will be responsible for reporting on their efforts to ensure the increased participation of veteran women in decision making mechanisms.
Timeframe
The implementation period for the National Action Plan of El Salvador is six years (2017-2022).",,"By 2022, the commitments of El Salvador to Women, Peace and Security will be based on the following objectives:
Promote the participation of women in all decision making levels throughout peace processes and decision making on peace and security  both nationally and internationally;
Promote a culture of zero-tolerance regarding violence against women based on the creation of a mechanism of prevention, particularly to sexual violence;

",3,Latin America & Caribbean,"El Salvador adopted its first National Action Plan NAP in 2017 for the period 2017-2022 and its most recent for the period 2022-2024. Analysis is forthcoming. The 2017-2022 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women, and the Implementation Committee and its Technical Monitoring Committee. These entities were tasked with convening with UN Women, the United States Agency for International Development USAID, the Spanish Agency for International Development and Cooperation, the Central American Integration System, and the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy as well as consulting with the Government of Chile. The NAP aims to strengthen women'ss participation in all decision-making levels of peace processes; creating a culture of zero-tolerance for violence against women; offering protections and basic services to women and girls; increasing reparations for women and girl victims of armed conflict; and strengthening the monitoring of the implementation of Resolution 1325. The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that includes actions, indicators, responsible entities, legal frames of reference, and a timeframe. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. El Salvador reported on the implementation of its NAP and the WPS Agenda in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others p. 50: The governmental and civil society institutions that make up the National Committee for the Implementation of the National Action Plan have carried out important actions in order to comply with the Plan, among them: Training and sensitization programs on Resolution 1325 have been implemented, directed to the personnel of the Armed Forces of El Salvador, as well as to the personnel who are in the process of Education and Training, to participate in Peacekeeping Operations Missions of the United Nations. Creation of the Network of Women Human Rights Defenders of Women working in the PNC. This is a mechanism to guarantee, defend and promote the rights of women working within the Police Corporation. The Network aims to guarantee and accompany the processes of care for women working in the institution, including students of the National Academy of Public Security, who are doing police internships in the PNC. Health care for women war veterans and women victims of serious human rights violations. Promotion of psychosocial support groups for women veterans and victims of war. There is a draft document of the Psychosocial Care Manual, which has been consulted with different organizations and experts and is in the process of being formalized. The most recent armed conflict in El Salvador'ss history is the civil war, which took place between 1980 and 1992. The country signed a peace agreement known as the Chapultepec Peace Accords in 1992, which outlined a comprehensive reconstruction plan based on widespread reforms. Women constituted 13 of negotiators and 12 of signatories; nevertheless, the peace agreement did not include any provisions on protecting and promoting women'ss rights. By 2022, the commitments of El Salvador to Women, Peace and Security will be based on the following objectives: Promote the participation of women in all decision making levels throughout peace processes and decision making on peace and security both nationally and internationally; Promote a culture of zero-tolerance regarding violence against women based on the creation of a mechanism of prevention, particularly to sexual violence; Note that women and girls are the most vulnerable and suffer because they are women and in this light, offer necessary mechanisms of protection and promotion of human rights, basic services for women and girls, while improving the justice system; Design and create implementation measures geared to safety and rehabilitation to respond timely to emergencies and support restitution and reparations for women and girl victims and survivors; Create activities in coordination with institutions and organisations to strengthen the implementation of UNSCR 1325. Each objective has different goals, actions, indicators and departments assigned to achieve these. For example, Objective 1 on ""increasing women'ss participation in peace processes and decision making on peace and security nationally and internationally includes the following: A.E.1.1.1: Renew existing regulatory frameworks in order to increase the active presence of women in State institutions, especially in public and citizen security institutions. Activity 1a:Instructions on how to regulate the equal participation of women and men of the National Civil Police in UN Peacekeeping Missions. Activity 1b: Support the hiring of more women in management positions within the the Ministry of Justice and Public Security. A.E.1.1.2: Guarantee the participation and equal representation of women in decision-making bodies on issues of public and citizen security. Activity 1a: Guarantee that the Ministry of Justice and Public Security creates more job opportunities for women Activity 1b: Promote the inclusion of veteran women in decision making A.E.1.1.3: Guarantee the participation of women in United Nations peacekeeping operations in which El Salvador participates as a contributing country Activity 1a: Systematize experiences of women participating in peace missions A.E.1.2.1: Develop and implement positive action measures to increase the participation and representation of women in State institutions Activity 1a: Communication campaign to encourage and motivate the participation of Salvadoran women in the National Civil Police Activity 1b: Preparation of instructions to regulate the increase and participation of women in the National Civil Police Activity 1c: Promote the participation of women veterans and survivors of the armed conflict in spaces of citizen comptrollership Activity 1d: Incorporate UNSCR 1325 into the Institutional Gender Policy for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Activity 1e: Incorporate the implementation of UNSCR 1325 into the Strategic Development Plan of the Armed Forces. To achieve each objective, the NAP has different indicators assigned. For example, Objective 1 on ""increasing women'ss participation in peace processes and decision making on peace and security nationally and internationally includes the following indicators or desired result: A.E.1.1.1: Renew existing regulatory frameworks in order to increase the active presence of women in State institutions, especially in public and citizen security institutions.

55,Estonia,4,1,1,,33.6,"Estonia approved its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2021 for the period 2020-2025. The NAP is preceded by two others, implemented for the periods 2015-2019 and 2010-2014. Analysis will be published in the near future. The 2015-2019 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Research, the Ministry of Defense and the Defense Forces, the Defense League, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Police and Border Guard Board. The NAP identifies civil society inclusion in the development of the NAP, but does not specify which civil society organizations were involved. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda both domestically and internationally, specifically through actions aimed at ensuring women'ss human rights through the promotion of gender equality as well as prevention and elimination of gender-based violence. The NAP outlines three main objectives: improve the situation of women in conflict and post-conflict settings, with specific attention to education and increase in opportunities; raise awareness of the impact of conflicts on women as well as of women'ss role in ensuring peace and security, particularly through increasing women'ss participation in conflict resolution processes; and enhance cooperation and information exchange on WPS implementation at the national and international level. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators, but the NAP does not have an allocated budget. Estonia'ss second is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010 and implemented for the period 2010-2014. The first NAP aimed to implement Resolution 1325 through the following overarching goals: political and diplomatic activities in international organizations; bilateral and multilateral development cooperation and humanitarian assistance; increasing the number of gender experts and trainings for institutions working on peace and security; and increasing the number of women in peacekeeping operations as well as in international positions related to peace and security. While the number of goals has decreased in the second NAP, the content remains consistently similar. Likewise, neither NAP has an allocated budget, while the second NAP indicates that ""planned measures will be carried out within the existing budgetary means” (p. 13). Estonia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Estonia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Estonia does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but has taken part in overseas military operations, including the Iraq War (2003-2011) and the War in Afghanistan (2001-2014). In 2004, Estonia enacted a Gender Equality Act, which prohibited gender-based discrimination in the public and private sector as well as promoting equal pay among genders. In 2016, Estonia elected its first woman president, Kersti Kaljulaid. In 2019, Estonia established a national human rights institution. In the current moment, Estonia has been experiencing ongoing tension with Russia as a result of the latter'ss military activities, including placement of troops and ballistic missiles, in the Baltic Sea Region.",1991,26,2014,656M,"The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with representatives from the Ministry of Education and Research, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Interior, and the Police and Border Guard Board. Although the NAP indicates participation of the civil society organizations in the development process, none of those organizations are specified.
Implementation
Adopting an outward-facing approach, the NAP focuses on implementing its activities internationally (Page 3) in partnerships with relevant international actors and with a focus on priority partner countries of Estonia'ss development cooperation and humanitarian aid, including Afghanistan, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia and Belarus (Page 6). Government ministries are primarily responsible for the implementation of the NAP, specifically the Ministry of Foregin Affairs and Ministry of Defence. Other offices including the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Education and Research are also tasked with the implementation of different activities in cooperation with the Defense League, Women'ss Voluntary Defense Organization, and other NGOs, higher education, and research institutions (Pages 7-15). The role of civil society is mostly emphasized in actions aiming at ensuring women'ss human rights and capacity building in conflict and post-conflict areas and at raising awareness on the local level regarding the WPS agenda.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP states that the agencies and NGOs that are responsible for implementing the activities will be requested to submit progress reports due in the second halves of 2023 and 2025 for review by the Government of the Republic (Page 15).",The implementation period of the NAP is 2020-2025.,"The NAP has four main objectives: 
Cooperation, exchange of information, and promotion of the objectives of Resolution 1325 at the international level;
Support for women'ss human rights and women'ss empowerment in conflict and post conflict areas;
Increasing sectoral expertise in the field of women, peace, and security in agencies and raising awareness in Estonia in general;
Increasing the representation of women in positions related to ensuring peace and security in Estonia, including opportunities to participate in international military and civilian operations.
The NAP also aims to focus on emerging global trends in relation to the topic of Women, Peace and Security, namely cybersecurity, climate change and Covid-19 recovery. ",The NAP outlines several sets of activities to address its objectives. Each activity has an indicator and identifies the actors that are responsible for implementation. The activities in the NAP aim at ensuring and supporting women'ss human rights through gender mainstreaming in collaboration with relevant international actors and civil society organizations and educational institutions; promotion of accountability for the violations of women'ss human rights; and capacity building of relevant actors on addressing gender-based violence.,"An indicator is listed for each action set out under the subset of objectives. For example, under the objective of ensuring women'ss human rights and women'ss empowerment in conflict and post-conflict areas, the indicator for the activity of ""In the framework of multilateral development cooperation and humanitarian aid, making voluntary donations to organizations active in the field of women'ss human rights and the improvement of the situation of women and girls and the promotion of gender equality in society in general”   is the ""Volume of voluntary contributions and their share of total development cooperation and humanitarian aid” (Page 9).","The implementation of the NAP will be tracked and reports will be written to evaluate progress on the activities. The implementing entities are each required to submit two written overviews of their progress on the activities of the NAP. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will develop a report on the implementation of the NAP, based on the submitted reviews, to the Government of the Republic. ","The NAP does not have an allocated budget, although there is reference to funding for organizations in the field of women's human rights.","The Estonian National Action Plan does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity.","Survey Violence against Women in Estonia: Research and statistical data > Dedicated violence against women survey

While the number of goals has decreased in the second NAP, the content remains consistently similar. Likewise, neither NAP has an allocated budget, while the second NAP indicates that ""planned measures will be carried out within the existing budgetary means p. 13. Estonia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Estonia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Estonia does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but has taken part in overseas military operations, including the Iraq War 2003-2011 and the War in Afghanistan 2001-2014. In 2004, Estonia enacted a Gender Equality Act, which prohibited gender-based discrimination in the public and private sector as well as promoting equal pay among genders. In 2016, Estonia elected its first woman president, Kersti Kaljulaid. In 2019, Estonia established a national human rights institution. In the current moment, Estonia has been experiencing ongoing tension with Russia as a result of the latter'ss military activities, including placement of troops and ballistic missiles, in the Baltic Sea Region. The NAP has four main objectives: Cooperation, exchange of information, and promotion of the objectives of Resolution 1325 at the international level; Support for women'ss human rights and women'ss empowerment in conflict and post conflict areas; Increasing sectoral expertise in the field of women, peace, and security in agencies and raising awareness in Estonia in general; Increasing the representation of women in positions related to ensuring peace and security in Estonia, including opportunities to participate in international military and civilian operations. The NAP also aims to focus on emerging global trends in relation to the topic of Women, Peace and Security, namely cybersecurity, climate change and Covid-19 recovery. The NAP outlines several sets of activities to address its objectives. Each activity has an indicator and identifies the actors that are responsible for implementation. The activities in the NAP aim at ensuring and supporting women'ss human rights through gender mainstreaming in collaboration with relevant international actors and civil society organizations and educational institutions; promotion of accountability for the violations of women'ss human rights; and capacity building of relevant actors on addressing gender-based violence. An indicator is listed for each action set out under the subset of objectives. For example, under the objective of ensuring women'ss human rights and women'ss empowerment in conflict and post-conflict areas, the indicator for the activity of ""In the framework of multilateral development cooperation and humanitarian aid, making voluntary donations to organizations active in the field of women'ss human rights and the improvement of the situation of women and girls and the promotion of gender equality in society in general is the ""Volume of voluntary contributions and their share of total development cooperation and humanitarian aid Page 9. The implementation of the NAP will be tracked and reports will be written to evaluate progress on the activities. The implementing entities are each required to submit two written overviews of their progress on the activities of the NAP. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will develop a report on the implementation of the NAP, based on the submitted reviews, to the Government of the Republic. The NAP does not have an allocated budget, although there is reference to funding for organizations in the field of women's human rights. The Estonian National Action Plan does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity."

60,Finland,8,1,1,,30.7,"Finland adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2023 for the period 2023-2027. The NAP was developed with administrative branches and civil society through workshops, seminars and evaluation of the previous NAP (p. 33). The cross-administrative WPS monitoring group coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs played a key role in preparing the finalized version of the NAP, and the NAP states that the expertise of NGOs and civil society was tapped across a broad front (p.33). The implementation of the NAP will be primarily coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Ministry of the Interior and the Crisis Management Centre (CMC Finland), which operates in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Environment. NGOs that have committed to implementing the NAP include Finn Church Aid, the Rule of Law Centre, the Finnish Refugee Council, the Finnish Red Cross, and the Family Federation of Finland. Finland'ss NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and identifies five thematic objectives: conflict prevention and peacebuilding; peace processes and peace mediation; security sector, crisis management, and crisis preparedness; safety of women and girls and realization of their rights in conflicts; and mainstreaming and advocacy (p28). The NAP also outlines principles that underscore the country'ss approach to lasting peace, conflict prevention and crisis management, including: human rights-based planning; the concept of comprehensive security (e.g. impacts of climate change, health threats, human rights violations, migration, economic crises, inequalities as well as recognising that peace is not just the absence of violent conflict, but an equal and democratic society underpinned by human rights and human security); a gender transformative approach; and intersectionality (p.24). The NAP does not include monitoring and implementation indicators. Instead, it states that a separate implementation plan will be drawn up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and indicators will be created to underpin the monitoring of the plan (p.73). Despite an evaluation report of Finland'ss third NAP stating that the greatest challenges in implementation were associated with undersized personnel and budgetary resources, no clear budget is mentioned in the fourth NAP (p.23). The three former NAPs were adopted in 2008, 2012 and 2018, for the periods 2008-2011, 2012-2016, and 2018-2021 respectively. The structure and level of detail across Finland'ss NAPs remains similar, with each NAP focusing on conflict prevention, peace processes and peacebuilding and crisis management, with the safety and human rights of women and girls appearing as an overarching objective across them all. Additionally, the fourth NAP continues the work of the third NAP in terms of addressing disarmament with a specific outcome focused on incorporating gender perspectives into arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation (p.38). The fourth NAP, however, also has an additional section relating to mainstreaming of the WPS agenda, and the advocacy work that Finland aims to do at the country and international level (p.69). Finland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but experiences ongoing political tension because of the military exercises conducted by Russia in the Baltic Sea Region. Additionally, about six months prior to the publication of the fourth NAP, Finland formally joined NATO , which is a major policy shift away from non-alignment. Domestically and regionally, Finland works on the WPS agenda through diplomacy, crisis management, development cooperation, humanitarian aid and other expert work and training with EU policy measures. Internationally, Finland has collaborated with the governments of Afghanistan, Kenya and Nepal to support their efforts in the implementation and follow-up of their WPS NAPs. Finland is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for GBV in humanitarian emergencies.",1986,3,2014,4.82B,"NAP Development

NAP Implementation  
The implementation of the NAP will be primarily coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Ministry of the Interior and the Crisis Management Centre (CMC Finland), which operates in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Environment. NGOs that have committed to implementing the NAP include Finn Church Aid, the Rule of Law Centre, the Finnish Refugee Council, the Finnish Red Cross, and the Family Federation of Finland.  
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation  
There is no specific information about the actors involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. The NAP states that a separate implementation plan and measures will be drawn up under the coordination of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure efficient implementation (p.73). It also states that the ""implementing parties” will participate in the preparation of this plan, establishing their areas of responsibility and updating it when necessary (p.73).  
WILPF 
WILPF Finland was founded in 1926 by Maikki Friberg, the long-time president of the Union of Women'ss Affairs and the group is the oldest women'ss peace organization in Finland. WILPF Finland is part of various initiatives at the national level, including against Finnish membership of NATO. The section also works to raise awareness about UNSCR 1325.  ",The implementation period for Finland'ss fourth NAP is 2023-2027.,"Finland'ss fourth NAP identifies five overarching objectives:  
Conflict prevention and peacebuilding 
Involving actions that promote gender equality including enabling women's economic and political empowerment, supporting women'ss and girls's education, and promoting their sexual and reproductive health and rights (p.27) 
Peace processes and peace mediation 
Involving actions that promote women'ss status and their involvement in peace mediation, dialogue and peace processes (p.27) 
Security sector, crisis management and crisis preparedness 
Aims to reinforce the WPS agenda within the military and civilian crisis management. Looks at the defense sector and NATO membership as boosts to the implementation of the WPS agenda (p.27) 
Safety of women and girls and realization of their rights in conflicts 
Aims to reduce violence against women and girls, women'ss access to legal protection as well as legal responsibility. Also includes the protection of human rights defenders and women'ss role in humanitarian assistance activities  
Mainstreaming and advocacy 
To continue efforts to intensify the WPS agenda at normative level and raise awareness of it, in particular within international organizations - UN, OSCE, EU, AU and NATO ","Strategic outcomes are listed at the end of each objective'ss ‘chapter's, which includes various results and sub-results to achieve the overall objectives.

Objective 4: The safety and rights of women and girls are better safeguarded and their diverse needs are better met during crises  
Gender perspective and the participation of women in all their diversity in humanitarian assistance work is promoted  
In humanitarian fora, Finland emphasizes the special needs of women and girls in vulnerable situations (including women with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, older women) and promotes the accessibility of humanitarian assistance  ","There are no specific indicators mentioned in the NAP.

However, it states that the responsibility for monitoring rests with ""responsible parties” in the central government and that civil society actors will bring important added value to the monitoring of the NAP (p.73). The NAP also adds that progress will be followed up by a national monitoring group led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noting that representatives of the parties responsible for implementing the NAP, including ministries and NGOs as well as the Finnish National Women, Peace and Security Network, will be invited to participate in the monitoring group.

61,France,5,1,1,,,"France's current National Action Plan on WPS has the implementation period 2021 to 2025. It is preceded by two others. France structured its third nap around the thematic pillars of prevention, protection (including the fight against impunity), participation and promotion of the agenda. It states that the NAP is aligned with its international strategy for gender equality (2018-2022), the EU'ss Women, Peace and Security regional action plan for 2019-2024, and the European Union gender action plan (GAP III). France'ss commitment to implementing the women, peace and security agenda is aligned with its feminist diplomacy policy, which concerns its external actions and is based on France'ss international strategy on gender equality. France does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions as well as having been involved in interventions in insurgencies and conflicts in the Central African Republic, the Maghreb, and Mali. In 2019, France was among the top 10 military spenders as well as being among top 5 arms exporters in the world. France is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, France is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, holding veto power on all Council decisions, and possesses nuclear weapons.",1983,15,2014,50B,"In the process of implementing the last two NAPs and developing the current one, France assigned the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Armed Forces; the Ministry of Culture; the Ministry of the Interior; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry for National Education, Youth and Sport; the Ministry for Higher Education, Research and Innovation; the Ministry for Gender Equality, Diversity and Equal opportunities; the Agence Française Développement; and the French office for the protection of refugees and stateless persons. The Ministry for Solidarity and Health was also consulted to provide its expertise on sexual and reproductive rights and health. The national consultative Commission on Human Rights, the High Council for Gender Equality, and civil society were consulted for drafting and will participate in implementation. ",The timeframe of the NAP is 2021-2025.,"Strengthen and develop the available training specifically on the inclusion of gender and the protection of women against sexual violence and violent extremisms in conflict and post-conflict situations. Every stakeholder concerned by this plan will be responsible for providing  training to all the staff in charge of the implementation, especially law enforcement and the judiciary, and in particular the personas in charge of welcoming and guiding survivors of violence in France and abroad. 
Continue to develop teaching tools for including gender and protection against sexual violence and violent extremisms in conflict and post-conflict situations (information sheets, models, regular seminars presenting agenda topics).
Continue education policies on prevention and fighting gender inequalities and sexist and sexual violence, which help train future citizens, renew community education and youth initiatives, and develop actions in the fields of informal and non-formal education. 
Strengthen French programmes dedicated to gender challenges in conflict and post-conflict humanitarian contexts, especially in coordination with civil society in countries where these programmes are applied, increase the specific support that must be provided for women and girls who are survivors of violence, including sexual violence; include the OECD ""gender” marker in bilateral humanitarian projects, as France committed to in tis humanitarian strategy for 2018-2022 and continue to advocate for its incorporation by the UN and European Agencies, funds and programmes. 
Strengthen support to the documentation, collection and analysis of sex-disaggregated data and investigations into sexual violence.",,,"The NAP states that civil society will be closely involved in monitoring implementation. To this end, a regular dialogue will be institutionalized with French civil society and that of the priority countries for all challenges linked to the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda.

",4,Western Europe,"France's current National Action Plan on WPS has the implementation period 2021 to 2025. It is preceded by two others. France structured its third nap around the thematic pillars of prevention, protection including the fight against impunity, participation and promotion of the agenda. It states that the NAP is aligned with its international strategy for gender equality 2018-2022, the EU'ss Women, Peace and Security regional action plan for 2019-2024, and the European Union gender action plan GAP III. France'ss commitment to implementing the women, peace and security agenda is aligned with its feminist diplomacy policy, which concerns its external actions and is based on France'ss international strategy on gender equality. France does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions as well as having been involved in interventions in insurgencies and conflicts in the Central African Republic, the Maghreb, and Mali. In 2019, France was among the top 10 military spenders as well as being among top 5 arms exporters in the world. France is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, France is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, holding veto power on all Council decisions, and possesses nuclear weapons. Strengthen and develop the available training specifically on the inclusion of gender and the protection of women against sexual violence and violent extremisms in conflict and post-conflict situations. Every stakeholder concerned by this plan will be responsible for providing training to all the staff in charge of the implementation, especially law enforcement and the judiciary, and in particular the personas in charge of welcoming and guiding survivors of violence in France and abroad. Continue to develop teaching tools for including gender and protection against sexual violence and violent extremisms in conflict and post-conflict situations information sheets, models, regular seminars presenting agenda topics. Continue education policies on prevention and fighting gender inequalities and sexist and sexual violence, which help train future citizens, renew community education and youth initiatives, and develop actions in the fields of informal and non-formal education. Strengthen French programmes dedicated to gender challenges in conflict and post-conflict humanitarian contexts, especially in coordination with civil society in countries where these programmes are applied, increase the specific support that must be provided for women and girls who are survivors of violence, including sexual violence; include the OECD ""gender marker in bilateral humanitarian projects, as France committed to in tis humanitarian strategy for 2018-2022 and continue to advocate for its incorporation by the UN and European Agencies, funds and programmes. Strengthen support to the documentation, collection and analysis of sex-disaggregated data and investigations into sexual violence. The NAP states that civil society will be closely involved in monitoring implementation. To this end, a regular dialogue will be institutionalized with French civil society and that of the priority countries for all challenges linked to the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. The implementation will be evaluated by the High Council for Gender Equality and the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. A report of the plan will be presented to the National Assembly and the Senate. The NAP references financing and budget in relation to the successful implementation of different activities of the NAP."
62,Gabon,22,1,1,,,,1983,,,271.5M,"NAP Development
The development stages of the NAP took place over the period of 2015-2020, headed by the Ministry for the Promotion and Integration of Women in Development, with inputs from actors in public institutions and communities, civil society, media and technical and financial partners.  Actors in civil society and the security sector, traditional chiefs, and partners were also participants in general consultations (p. 11).  The key steps for NAP development outlined in the guide for the implementation of UNSCR 1325 published by West African Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP) were followed.
NAP Implementation
The Ministry for the Promotion and Integration of Women in Development is responsible for coordination, including formalizing governmental bodies such the Interministerial Committee on WPS, defining the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and mechanisms for the involvement and participation of representatives of ministries, parliament, civil society organizations (CSOs), the private sector, political parties, governmental programmes, the UN system and technical & financial partners (p. 16).
Implementation will be based on a system that collects, analyzes and distributes data in close coordination with the Director General of Statistics (p. 22).  At the institutional level, it will involve the creation of a set of procedures to allow communication between different actors at the central, provincial, municipal and local levels.  These actors fall under the groups including parliament, magistrate/judicial institutions, ministries, central and local administration institutions, political parties, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), CSOs, the academic and scientific community, media/press, communities and families, and international partners (p. 16).  
NAP monitoring and evaluation
The National Monitoring Committee will meet, under the direction of the supervising ministry, in order to share achievements, evaluate progress and challenges, and formulate recommendations.  The data collected by the WPS focal points of different institutions will contribute to an annual national report, under the coordination of the supervising ministry.  Civil society will also carry out a mid-term independent evaluation.  The four year operational plan for the NAP will be updated in light of the results, challenges raised and recommendations formulated by this reporting (p. 22).  
Civil Society
Gabon'ss NAP states that it recognizes the essential role that CSOs play in the advancement and implementation of the WPS Agenda, essential service provision, and providing crucial support for women in post-conflict contests.  A continuous dialogue maintained in a framework of exchange and learning called called «Communauté de pratiques» (‘Community of Practice's) will help to institutionalize the participation of CSOs and women'ss groups in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the NAP and the WPS Agenda.  A network of organizations and movements defending the rights of women in different areas of the country will be consolidated in order to implement innovative actions on WPS (p. 23).",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2020-2023.,"There are two overarching objectives that Gabon'ss NAP aims to address: firstly, increasing the participation of women in decision-making processes and their full participation in all peace and security efforts; secondly, eradicating women'ss human rights violations including sexual violence against women and girls and the trafficking of women and children (p. 13).
The NAP focuses on six priorities, called axes (p. 3 and p. 13):
Prevention, management and transformation of conflicts at the national and sub-regional levels, and the fight against gender-based violence.
The protection and respect for the human rights of women and girls, and taking into account issues related to gender equality in politics and programmes of relief and recovery in conflict and post-conflict situations 
The equal participations and representation of women in decision-making institutions and peacebuilding mechanisms at the national, sub-regional, regional and international levels
Women, girls and the management of the environment and climate change
The economic empowerment and inclusion of women 
The coordination, promotion and implementation of UNSCR 1325, mobilization of resources, sustainable partnerships, and monitoring & evaluation of the NAP.
The NAP focuses on these axes through six objectives (p. 13-14)
The prevention, management and transformation of conflicts at the national and sub-regional levels, and the integration of gender mainstreaming in all conflict prevention strategies and activities, the creation of mechanisms and institutions which take into account the needs of women and redoubling efforts to prevent violence against women, in particular diverse forms of sexual violence.
Assure the protection and defence of the human rights of women and girls, taking into account issues of gender equality, increasing efforts on matters of protection and physical & mental health, as well as the dignity of women and girls, and integrating gender mainstreaming in legal and institutional reforms.
a) Promote and support the active and meaningful participation of women in all peace processes as well as their equal representation in official and informal decision-making bodies, and peacebuilding mechanisms at the national, sub-regional, regional and international levels; b) Improve the work in partnership and in network with associations and organizations defending the rights of women at the local, national, sub-regional and international levels, and to support the appointment of women in key positions in the military and civilian defence and law enforcement forces.
Promote the concepts of gender and climate involving women and girls, and in reinforcing their resilience and capacity for adaptation in the face of climate hazards, natural risks and catastrophes, and climate management.
Reinforce the efforts for women'ss economic security, increase the production potential, and significantly increase the economic and social development of the country, and women'ss emancipation through their empowerment and economic inclusion.
Ensure the coordination, promotion of ownership and implementation of resolution 1325, mobilization of resources, establishment of strategic, sustainable partnerships and the monitoring & evaluation of a NAP and associated programmes and projects. ","In Gabon'ss NAP, a logistical framework allocates each of the six axes a set of products.  Under the operational framework, each of those products are assigned a subset of actions, each with an associated responsible body and timeframe. 
For example, under axis 2 of ""protection and respect for the human rights of women and girls, and taking into account issues related to gender equality in politics and programmes of relief and recovery in conflict and post-conflict situations"", there are four products such as (p. 42): 
Project 2.2 ""Joint projects on the integration of Resolution 1325 in programmes fighting against national and regional threats to peace are realized (terrorism, violent extremism, martime piracy, transnational crime, small arms and light weapons"". This project has actions including: Implement regional projects on planning and budgeting methods according to gender; and Initiate studies and publish regular reports with gender disaggregated data on all sectors. 
The 2020 Roadmap, which outlines actions and priorities for the first year of implementation, contains eleven axes of intervention and forty-eight priority actions (p. 16), each action with an associated responsible body, budget and timeframe.  For example, under Axis 7 ""Reinforce the capacities of stakeholder parties"" (p. 72) there are seven associated actions, such as:
Organize a training workshop on project identification and formulation, and the development of a resource mobilization strategy. Responsible bodies: the Ministry in charge of the Promotion of Women and other stakeholder parties. Timeframe: June 2020.","Each product in the logistical framework and each action in the operational framework of Gabon'ss NAP is given a set of indicators, as well as sources of verification.  
For example, under axis 4, action 4.2.1 ""Contribute to the development of a strategy for emissions reduction related to deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in connection with the benefits of adaptation taking gender-sensitivity into account in the forestry sector"" includes the indicator: ""The existence of a emissions reduction strategy related to deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+)""","The logistical framework of Gabon'ss NAP contains not only indicators but also includes hypotheses and risks predicted for each product (p. 28-27).  A toolbox, including a framework of risk mitigation, will be developed.  The National Monitoring Committee will meet, under the direction of the supervising ministry, in order to share achievements, evaluate progress and challenges, and formulate recommendations.  Other platforms for these activities will be developed as necessary over the course of implementation.  The data collected by the WPS Focal Points of different institutions will contribute to an annual national report, under the coordination of the supervising ministry.  Civil society will also carry out a mid-term independent evaluation.  The four year operational plan for the NAP will be updated based on the results, challenges raised and recommendations formulated in this report (p. 22-23).  ","The total amount budgeted to Gabon'ss NAP is 3,033,950 000 F.CFA (Central African CFA Franc) or $5,056,583 USD, across the six national priorities.  Priority 1 is budgeted the most at 1,187,500,000 F.CFA ($1,979,167 USD), and Priority 5 budgeted the least at 116,500,000 F.CFA ($194,167 USD).  The 2020 Roadmap is budgeted 527,000,000 F.CFA ($876,334 USD) across its eleven axes of intervention, bringing the total budget to 3,560,950,000 F.CFA ($5,932,917 USD) (p. 17-20).
Each action in both the NAP Axis and 2020 Roadmap are allocated a cost, with the former having an allocation for each of the four years of implementation.","Disarmament is discussed in axis 1, which focuses on conflict prevention.  Action 1.2.3 makes direct references to disarmament and small arms and light weapons (SALW): Develop and implement disarmament plans, and fight against the proliferation of SALW.  Product 2.2 also identifies SALW among the threats to national and regional peace.
The NAP also identities women in post-conflict and relief & recovery projects, with specific references to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR).  For example Product 2.4 makes specific references to women'ss specific needs and interests in post-conflict projects such as DDR, as well as post-conflict justice, and repatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration of victims of armed conflict (p. 30), with its Action 2.4.2 making direct reference to the capacities of women in matters of security sector reform, DDR, the fight against SALW, and reconciliation (p. 43).","Act No 2496 of 6 January 1996: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

The NAP focuses on six priorities, called axes p. 3 and p. 13: Prevention, management and transformation of conflicts at the national and sub-regional levels, and the fight against gender-based violence. The protection and respect for the human rights of women and girls, and taking into account issues related to gender equality in politics and programmes of relief and recovery in conflict and post-conflict situations The equal participations and representation of women in decision-making institutions and peacebuilding mechanisms at the national, sub-regional, regional and international levels Women, girls and the management of the environment and climate change The economic empowerment and inclusion of women The coordination, promotion and implementation of UNSCR 1325, mobilization of resources, sustainable partnerships, and monitoring  evaluation of the NAP. The NAP focuses on these axes through six objectives p. 13-14 The prevention, management and transformation of conflicts at the national and sub-regional levels, and the integration of gender mainstreaming in all conflict prevention strategies and activities, the creation of mechanisms and institutions which take into account the needs of women and redoubling efforts to prevent violence against women, in particular diverse forms of sexual violence. Assure the protection and defence of the human rights of women and girls, taking into account issues of gender equality, increasing efforts on matters of protection and physical  mental health, as well as the dignity of women and girls, and integrating gender mainstreaming in legal and institutional reforms. a Promote and support the active and meaningful participation of women in all peace processes as well as their equal representation in official and informal decision-making bodies, and peacebuilding mechanisms at the national, sub-regional, regional and international levels; b Improve the work in partnership and in network with associations and organizations defending the rights of women at the local, national, sub-regional and international levels, and to support the appointment of women in key positions in the military and civilian defence and law enforcement forces. Promote the concepts of gender and climate involving women and girls, and in reinforcing their resilience and capacity for adaptation in the face of climate hazards, natural risks and catastrophes, and climate management. Reinforce the efforts for women'ss economic security, increase the production potential, and significantly increase the economic and social development of the country, and women'ss emancipation through their empowerment and economic inclusion. Ensure the coordination, promotion of ownership and implementation of resolution 1325, mobilization of resources, establishment of strategic, sustainable partnerships and the monitoring  evaluation of a NAP and associated programmes and projects. In Gabon'ss NAP, a logistical framework allocates each of the six axes a set of products. Under the operational framework, each of those products are assigned a subset of actions, each with an associated responsible body and timeframe. For example, under axis 2 of ""protection and respect for the human rights of women and girls, and taking into account issues related to gender equality in politics and programmes of relief and recovery in conflict and post-conflict situations"", there are four products such as p. 42: Project 2.2 ""Joint projects on the integration of Resolution 1325 in programmes fighting against national and regional threats to peace are realized terrorism, violent extremism, martime piracy, transnational crime, small arms and light weapons"". This project has actions including: Implement regional projects on planning and budgeting methods according to gender; and Initiate studies and publish regular reports with gender disaggregated data on all sectors. The 2020 Roadmap, which outlines actions and priorities for the first year of implementation, contains eleven axes of intervention and forty-eight priority actions p. 16, each action with an associated responsible body, budget and timeframe. For example, under Axis 7 ""Reinforce the capacities of stakeholder parties"" p. 72 there are seven associated actions, such as: Organize a training workshop on project identification and formulation, and the development of a resource mobilization strategy. Responsible bodies: the Ministry in charge of the Promotion of Women and other stakeholder parties. Timeframe: June 2020. Each product in the logistical framework and each action in the operational framework of Gabon'ss NAP is given a set of indicators, as well as sources of verification. For example, under axis 4, action 4.2.1 ""Contribute to the development of a strategy for emissions reduction related to deforestation and forest degradation REDD in connection with the benefits of adaptation taking gender-sensitivity into account in the forestry sector"" includes the indicator: ""The existence of a emissions reduction strategy related to deforestation and forest degradation REDD"" The logistical framework of Gabon'ss NAP contains not only indicators but also includes hypotheses and risks predicted for each product p. 28-27. A toolbox, including a framework of risk mitigation, will be developed. The National Monitoring Committee will meet, under the direction of the supervising ministry, in order to share achievements, evaluate progress and challenges, and formulate recommendations. Other platforms for these activities will be developed as necessary over the course of implementation. The data collected by the WPS Focal Points of different institutions will contribute to an annual national report, under the coordination of the supervising ministry. Civil society will also carry out a mid-term independent evaluation. The four year operational plan for the NAP will be updated based on the results, challenges raised and recommendations formulated in this report p. 22-23. The total amount budgeted to Gabon'ss NAP is 3,033,950 000 F.CFA Central African CFA Franc or 5,056,583 USD, across the six national priorities. Priority 1 is budgeted the most at 1,187,500,000 F.CFA 1,979,167 USD, and Priority 5 budgeted the least at 116,500,000 F.CFA 194,167 USD. The 2020 Roadmap is budgeted 527,000,000 F.CFA 876,334 USD across its eleven axes of intervention, bringing the total budget to 3,560,950,000 F.CFA 5,932,917 USD p. 17-20. Each action in both the NAP Axis and 2020 Roadmap are allocated a cost, with the former having an allocation for each of the four years of implementation. Disarmament is discussed in axis 1, which focuses on conflict prevention. Action 1.2.3 makes direct references to disarmament and small arms and light weapons SALW: Develop and implement disarmament plans, and fight against the proliferation of SALW. Product 2.2 also identifies SALW among the threats to national and regional peace. The NAP also identities women in post-conflict and relief  recovery projects, with specific references to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration DDR. For example Product 2.4 makes specific references to women'ss specific needs and interests in post-conflict projects such as DDR, as well as post-conflict justice, and repatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration of victims of armed conflict p. 30, with its Action 2.4.2 making direct reference to the capacities of women in matters of security sector reform, DDR, the fight against SALW, and reconciliation p. 43."

64,Georgia,3,1,1,82.4,,"The 2022-2023 NAP was developed by the Inter-Agency Commission on Gender Equality, Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (hereinafter the Commission), with UN Women technical support within the framework of the project ""Accelerating Implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda in Georgia”, which was funded by the U.K. Government'ss Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) (p.6). The process of drafting the NAP was coordinated by the Human Rights Secretariat of the Government of Georgia, with representatives of local and international non-governmental organizations, relevant experts, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders taking part in working meetings and consultations (p.6). The NAP interprets the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda primarily in a domestic sense, with a heavy focus on conflict-affected areas, internally displaced persons, and occupied territories within Georgia. That said, the NAP includes plans on mainstreaming the WPS agenda in international diplomatic activities as well. The NAP has three impact areas: women'ss participation; elimination and prevention of violence; and women'ss empowerment and protection. These thematic priority areas identify corresponding actions and indicators, including baseline and target indicators, and the organization or government department responsible for verifying and collecting data. The monitoring and evaluation framework for the NAP is broad and includes the Commission providing periodic reports, the Human Rights Secretariat engaging with stakeholders and providing recommendations for amendments if need be, and six-monthly progress reports throughout the timeframe of the NAP (p. 18-19). The NAP has an allocated budget of GEL 27,680,907 (roughly USD $10,426,877) (p.18.). The NAP also lays out the budget for some specific activities, including amount and source of funding. Georgia'ss fourth NAP is preceded by three other NAPs, implemented for the period of 2012-2015, 2016-2017, and 2018-2020, respectively. Georgia'ss first NAP forms part of broader national efforts to mainstream gender and was developed following the adoption of the Law on Gender Equality in 2010, and the establishment of the Council for Gender Equality. Working at the national level to the grassroots level and in cooperation with international donors and UN agencies, the NAP says that women'ss organizations have been instrumental in the development and implementation of the NAP in Georgia. The country'ss four NAPs are similar in structure and level of detail. Each NAP is primarily an implementation matrix that includes goals, outputs, indicators, responsible party, and timeline. The second and third NAPs also include a preface that provides a brief overview of the implementation of previous NAPs as well as participatory drafting processes of NAPs. The fourth NAP expands on former iterations and includes a ‘situation analysis's that outlines and identifies existing challenges relating to the protection of women'ss social and economic rights and their meaningful participation in peace and security processes (p.7). Georgia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Since then, the country has experienced multiple periods of conflict, including the Abkhazia War (1992-1993) and the Russo-Georgian War (2008). Despite the fact that women have been mostly excluded from peace processes involving these conflicts, women-led groups and CSOs have continued to work with women impacted directly by the violence, including internally displaced women and girls. They have also consistently advocated for their inclusion in peacebuilding initiatives.",1994,76,2014,360M,"NAP Development 
The Georgia NAP was developed by the Commission with technical support from UN Women and funding from the UK Government'ss Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund (p.2). The Human Rights Secretariat of the Government of Georgia and the Advisor to the Prime Minister of Human Rights were also involved in the development of the NAP (p.6). Representatives of local and international non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations, relevant experts, and other stakeholders collaborated with these government departments through working meetings and discussions (p.6).
NAP Implementation 
The Commission is the main body responsible for the implementation of the NAP. It ensures NAP implementation through the Human Rights Secretariat of the Administration of the Government of Georgia (p.18). The Human Rights Secretariat provides supplemental support in implementation by engaging stakeholders throughout the implementation process (p.18). Additionally, for each output indicator listed in the NAP, a ‘responsible agency's has been designated to be in charge of implementation, alongside a partner agency if relevant. These include the following: The Office of the State Minister of Georgia for Reconciliation and Civic Equality; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia; Ministry of Internally Displaced Person from the Occupied Territories, Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia; Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia; Administration of South Ossetia; Embassy of Germany in Georgia; Embassy of Switzerland in Georgia; Embassy of the United Kingdom in Georgia; UN Women; Civil society organizations; Legal Aid Service.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation 
The Commission and the Human Rights Secretariat are responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. Information on the implementation of NAP activities will be processed in the form of progress and annual reports, to be submitted every six months during the NAP time frame (p.19). The first of these will be an Annual report after the first year, followed by a Progress report after an additional 6 months, followed by the next Annual report etc. ",The NAP implementation period is three years (2022-2024).,"The 2022-2024 NAP identifies three impact areas that set the vision for Georgia'ss WPS implementation strategy. These areas have been selected for their contributions to the four pillars of WPS, and their relevance across Georgia'ss broader foreign, development, defense and security policies. They include: 
(1) Women'ss Participation: increasing representation and meaningful participation of women (including at decision-making level) in peace and security processes
(2) Elimination and Prevention of Violence: promoting the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls (including sexual violence, gender-based violence and risks related to human security)
(3) Women'ss Empowerment and Protection: improving access to public services and the socioeconomic empowerment of women and girls affected by conflict (including IDPs and those living adjacent to the occupied territories)","Strategic outcomes have a comprehensive set of actions assigned. These are outlined in Annex A of the NAP (p. 38-47). It goes through all five strategic objectives, and lists the priority, the commitment, and the organizational lead for the action.","Each activity has a set of indicators attached. For example, for Goal 1, ""promoting the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls (including sexual violence, gender-based violence and risks related to human security)” the following indicators are listed: 
Share of conflict-affected women and girls (including IDPs and those living adjacent to the occupied territories) with an increased level of awareness on human security issues 
Share of security and justice sector personnel trained on the issues of preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence 
Share of trained gender advisers and military personnel (including military personnel participating in peacekeeping missions)
Each indicator is listed with a baseline statistic, meaning as of 2021, alongside the target 2024 statistic. A ‘source of verification's is also indicated i.e. the ministry/government department responsible for reporting the indicator.","The NAP will undergo regular evaluations in the form of monitoring reports. These will use the updated information on the implementation of NAP activities and will be submitted every six months during the timeframe of the NAP. All annual reports will be published on the official website of the Human Rights Secretariat in order to inform decision makers and stakeholders about the progress of the implementation of the NAP. Upon the completion of the NAP, a systemic evaluation will be carried out to determine the NAP'ss impact and ensure accountability.","The budget for the NAP totals GEL 27,680,907 (roughly USD $10,426,877).","Georgia'ss NAP does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity.","Amendment to the Imprisonment Code: Laws > Violence against women > Regulations

65,Germany,5,1,1,,31.7,"Germany adopted its third National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2021-2024. This NAP builds on the work of the previous two plans, implemented for the periods 2017-2020 and 2013-2016. It was developed by the Interministerial Working Group for Women, Peace and Security. Its six priority areas are c risis prevention; p articipation; p rotection and support; h umanitarian assistance, crisis management, and reconstruction; s trengthening the Women, Peace and Security Agenda; and i ncreasing institutional integration and capacities. Compared to the previous two NAPs, it contains an expanded monitoring and evaluation framework (page 42 onwards) which provides details on the implementation of activities. Although some indicators in the NAP indicate the allocation of financial resources, other budgetary details are not provided in the NAP. The previous NAP was adopted in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The second NAP identified five focal points towards the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda, including gender-sensitive conflict prevention; women'ss increased participation in conflict prevention and peacebuilding; increased attention to the needs of women and girls in humanitarian action; protection from sexual and gender-based violence; and promoting the WPS agenda at the national, regional, and international level. While each focal point had corresponding goals, the NAP did not identify specific indicators, a monitoring and evaluation framework, or an allocated budget. The first German NAP, implemented for 2013-2016, compiled its objectives under six thematic goals: prevention; preparation of operations, basic, advanced, and continued training; participation; protection; reintegration and reconstruction; and criminal prosecution. The NAP interpreted the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly internationally. In the first NAP, disarmament was approached through the framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration efforts (DDR). However, the second NAP expanded this focus by identifying incorporating a gender perspective into arms control projects as one of its objectives. The third NAP addresses disarmament within the context of conflict/crisis prevention and protection. Germany reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Germany does not have a recent history of internal armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions. In 2019, Germany was among the top 10 military spenders as well as being among top 5 arms exporters in the world. Germany is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Germany is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Germany was most recently a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2019-2020.",1985,10,2014,49B,"Development
The German Government'ss Third Action Plan for Women, Peace and Security is a document issued by the Interministerial Working Group for Women, Peace and Security (IMAG). The six ministries in this working group are the Federal Foreign Office (FFO); the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women, and Youth (BMFSFJ); the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building, and Community (BMI); the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection (BMJV); the Federal Ministry of Defence (BMVg); and the Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ). The NAP identifies that it builds on implementation report conclusions from previous NAPs as well as consultations with civil society both in Germany and abroad (including in conflict and post-conflict areas) and thematic experts (pg.11).
Implementation
According to the NAP (pg. 41), the ""entire German Government is tasked with preparing and implementing the Action Plan”. At the half-way stage of the NAP (approximately the end of 2022/early 2023), there will be an interactive exchange with civil society.
M&E
The ministries responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the NAP are the Federal Foreign Office (FFO/AA); the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women, and Youth (BMFSFJ); the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building, and Community (BMI); the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection (BMJV); the Federal Ministry of Defence (BMVg); and the Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ). There is a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan in the NAP (pg. 42 onwards).
WILPF
WILPF Germany continues to be actively engaged in advocacy for implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in Germany. As part of Network 1325, WILPF Germany contributed to a policy briefing to inform the process of the NAP development. This policy briefing was cited on page 11 of the NAP, and focused on the implementation of the agenda. This policy briefing contained numerous recommendations for the NAP in its third iteration, including:
Employing gender-sensitive conflict analysis;
Ensuring that at least 85% of German development aid from 2021 onwards directly or indirectly contributes to gender equality;
Fully realizing reproductive rights within Germany, including by eliminating Sections 218 and 219 of the German criminal code;
Substantively including women and girls who are refugees in the formulation of policy;
Working towards a complete cessation of arms exports.",The timeframe for this NAP is 2021-2024.,"The six priority areas of the NAP are:
Crisis prevention
Participation
Protection and support
Humanitarian assistance, crisis management, and reconstruction
Strengthening the Women, Peace and Security Agenda
Increasing institutional integration and capacities
These priority areas aim to cover all areas of the WPS agenda as well as strengthening the agenda and capacities for implementation. Additionally, the NAP aligns itself with foreign and some domestic policy in Germany.
Furthermore, the NAP adopts several principles that inform the implementation of the activities:
Exploring the causes of gender inequality (pg. 15)
WPS as a horizontal policy in work for the German peace and security strategy, development cooperation, and humanitarian assistance (pg. 16)",,"One or more indicators have been assigned to each target of the NAP. Some are qualitative and others are quantitative, and certain indicators have been derived from previous indicators in order to support consistent WPS implementation. 
Two examples of indicators are: ""Number and description of programmes, projects and initiatives which explore WPS-related ramifications of climate change, and of desertification, droughts and other results of climate change” and ""Number of women human rights defenders and women peacebuilders who have been supported by the Elisabeth Selbert Initiative”.
 ","The NAP features a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation Plan (pg. 42 onwards). Data will be collected on an ongoing basis, with responsibility in each ministry. There will also be an interactive exchange with civil society halfway through the NAP implementation to assess progress.
There are three implementation periods that have been identified: short-term measures by the end of 2021; medium-term measures to be implemented by the end of 2022, and long-term measures for prioritising WPS work","A specific budget is not detailed in the NAP, although the NAP includes indicators related to financing specific projects and initiatives.","Under the NAP objective of crisis prevention, there is a target related to gender and disarmament. This target is: ""Gender-based analyses are taken into account in controls of small arms and light firearms, in disarmament, and in arms controls and export controls. Participation by women in decision-making processes is also strengthened at all levels.”
The following measures related to disarmament are outlined under this target:
Reducing the illegal distribution and trade in small arms and light firearms on the basis of gender-based analyses and data collection. 
Increasing participation by women in national, regional and international processes for disarmament, arms control and arms export control; developing capacity through training and continuing professional development projects, in addition to establishing networks, in particular by promoting the global Gender Equality Network for Small Arms Control (GENSAC). 
Including the goals of the Women, Peace and Security agenda as a permanent part of the concluding documents for arms controls and arms export controls in international forums; collecting gender-based data on the use of certain weapons in specific countries and regions. 
As part of the risk analysis of potential human rights violations for arms export controls, an assessment is also made of the risk as to whether grievous acts of sexual and gender-based violence or serious violence against women and girls could be perpetrated using the requested military equipment (Arms Trade Treaty, Article 7(4)).
Additionally, under the goal of protection, the NAP draws the link between sexual and gender-based violence and arms: ""Sexual and gender-based violence is also associated with a growing social propensity to violence, militarisation, the proliferation of small arms and light firearms, fight and displacement, the collapse of the rule of law and the proximity of armed people to the civilian population. In the context of armed conflict, acts of sexual and gender-based violence are committed before, during and after the conflict.”
There is one indicator on conflict prevention and disarmament: ""Number and proportion of measures for conflict prevention, including control of small arms and light firearms and disarmament, and mediation (support), peacebuilding, peace negotiations, stabilisation, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance, which used gender-sensitive conflict analysis or requirements analysis, or other gender-responsive instruments for analysis”.","2nd Action Plan of the Federal Government to Combat Violence against Women: Policies > National action plan specific to violence against women

",4,Western Europe,"Germany adopted its third National Action Plan NAP for the period 2021-2024. This NAP builds on the work of the previous two plans, implemented for the periods 2017-2020 and 2013-2016. It was developed by the Interministerial Working Group for Women, Peace and Security. Its six priority areas are c risis prevention; p articipation; p rotection and support; h umanitarian assistance, crisis management, and reconstruction; s trengthening the Women, Peace and Security Agenda; and i ncreasing institutional integration and capacities. Compared to the previous two NAPs, it contains an expanded monitoring and evaluation framework page 42 onwards which provides details on the implementation of activities. Although some indicators in the NAP indicate the allocation of financial resources, other budgetary details are not provided in the NAP. The previous NAP was adopted in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The second NAP identified five focal points towards the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security WPS agenda, including gender-sensitive conflict prevention; women'ss increased participation in conflict prevention and peacebuilding; increased attention to the needs of women and girls in humanitarian action; protection from sexual and gender-based violence; and promoting the WPS agenda at the national, regional, and international level. While each focal point had corresponding goals, the NAP did not identify specific indicators, a monitoring and evaluation framework, or an allocated budget. The first German NAP, implemented for 2013-2016, compiled its objectives under six thematic goals: prevention; preparation of operations, basic, advanced, and continued training; participation; protection; reintegration and reconstruction; and criminal prosecution. The NAP interpreted the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly internationally. In the first NAP, disarmament was approached through the framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration efforts DDR. However, the second NAP expanded this focus by identifying incorporating a gender perspective into arms control projects as one of its objectives. The third NAP addresses disarmament within the context of conflictcrisis prevention and protection. Germany reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Germany does not have a recent history of internal armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions. In 2019, Germany was among the top 10 military spenders as well as being among top 5 arms exporters in the world. Germany is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Germany is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Germany was most recently a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2019-2020. The six priority areas of the NAP are: Crisis prevention Participation Protection and support Humanitarian assistance, crisis management, and reconstruction Strengthening the Women, Peace and Security Agenda Increasing institutional integration and capacities These priority areas aim to cover all areas of the WPS agenda as well as strengthening the agenda and capacities for implementation. Additionally, the NAP aligns itself with foreign and some domestic policy in Germany. Furthermore, the NAP adopts several principles that inform the implementation of the activities: Exploring the causes of gender inequality pg. 15 WPS as a horizontal policy in work for the German peace and security strategy, development cooperation, and humanitarian assistance pg. 16 One or more indicators have been assigned to each target of the NAP. Some are qualitative and others are quantitative, and certain indicators have been derived from previous indicators in order to support consistent WPS implementation. Two examples of indicators are: ""Number and description of programmes, projects and initiatives which explore WPS-related ramifications of climate change, and of desertification, droughts and other results of climate change and ""Number of women human rights defenders and women peacebuilders who have been supported by the Elisabeth Selbert Initiative. The NAP features a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation Plan pg. 42 onwards. Data will be collected on an ongoing basis, with responsibility in each ministry. There will also be an interactive exchange with civil society halfway through the NAP implementation to assess progress. There are three implementation periods that have been identified: short-term measures by the end of 2021; medium-term measures to be implemented by the end of 2022, and long-term measures for prioritising WPS work A specific budget is not detailed in the NAP, although the NAP includes indicators related to financing specific projects and initiatives. Under the NAP objective of crisis prevention, there is a target related to gender and disarmament. This target is: ""Gender-based analyses are taken into account in controls of small arms and light firearms, in disarmament, and in arms controls and export controls.

66,Ghana,10,1,1,,23.7,"Ghana adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2025. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MoGCSP) with participation and collaboration with local (WPSI KAIPTC, WILPF Ghana), regional (WANEP) and international (UNDP, Canadian High Commission) partners. The NAP acknowledges the inputs received from the Women, Peace and Security Institute-Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (WPSI-KAIPTC), West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP) and WILPF Ghana in the development of the NAP while also stating that civil society will be included in the NAP implementation process. The overall goal of the NAP is ""to build inclusive, secure and safe societies for women and girls in Ghana anchored on the tenets of UNSCR 1325” (p. 13). The NAP is structured with reference to the main pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation; protection; prevention; and recovery and rehabilitation. The NAP focuses heavily on advancing the implementation of Resolution 1325 through increased institutional structures, collaborations with stakeholders, creating a resource base, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. While the NAP has a detailed implementation matrix, it does not include an allocated budget. Ghana'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010, launched in 2012, and implemented for the 2012-2014 period. The first NAP was developed by the Ministry of Women and Children'ss Affairs with broad-based participation from civil society. The original implementation period of the NAP was 2012-2014, but the plan could not be put into effect for 2012 as a result of the amount of time it took to formally adopt it. There were also some critical gaps in the NAP'ss implementation: unavailability of an inter-ministerial steering committee to coordinate the implementation in a concerted manner; lack of a dedicated budget for the implementation; lack of a fundraising strategy and initiatives to raise funds to complement the Ministry'ss limited annual government funding; competing priorities and resources in the various implementing sector ministries; lack of coordination between different stakeholders; non-availability of a pool of women with capacity in Women Peace and Security (WPS) to spearhead the implementation coordinated by MoGCSP; and lack of awareness of the NAP among various security institutions and the general public (p. 6). The second NAP seeks to address the lessons learned and overcome the challenges faced in the implementation of Ghana'ss first NAP. Ghana reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others: The Kofi Annan International Peace Keeping Training Centre continues train an average of 100 professionals on Gender, Peace and Security every year. The Ghana Police Service has developed a gender policy to mainstream gender in their operations and administration. The Bureau of National Investigations has also established a gender office with a senior officer as the head. This agency currently has 52% women of the total staff population (p. 18). Ghana gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, after decades of colonial rule under the British empire. The country experienced multiple military coups in 1966, 1972, and 1981. Ghana does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but has experienced sporadic ethnic tension with adverse impacts on especially women and girls. In 2011, Ghana established a Women, Peace, and Security Institute with the goal to increase women'ss participation in peace negotiations, peacekeeping activities, and preventive diplomacy efforts in Africa. At the multilateral level, Ghana was most recently a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2006-2007.",1986,107,2015,244M,,"GHANAP 1
The Ghana NAP covers the time period of 2012 to 2014. No specific timeframe is set on the Action / Activities. For every output objective the timeframe states 2012-2014. There is no scheduled deadline for implementation, monitoring or evaluation.

GHANAP 2
GHANAP 2 states that ""while the overall monitoring and evaluation will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Gender Children and Social Protection, the (M&E) framework has built-in mechanisms at the different levels of implementation which also allows for adjustments to be made in course of implementation based on unforeseen circumstances and emerging opportunities.” (p 21)","GHANAP 1
Ghana's NAP mentions the importance of allocation and material resources towards the implementation of the National Action Plan however there is no specific allocated budget in Ghana's NAP.

The Domestic sources are state and non-state actors operating within Ghana. They include direct Government of Ghana (GoG) budget funding and funding from private and corporate organizations operating in Ghana.”
 Additionally, it also states that ""MoGCSP in its annual budget will make provisions for adequate funds for the implementation of GHANAP 2. The supporting ministries of Defence, Interior, Finance, Local Government and Foreign Affairs will also budget for their roles in relation to the various aspects of the GHANAP 2 pillars they are committed to. Budgets of the MMDAs will make allocations in the District Assembly Common Fund (DACF) and their Internally Generated Funds (IGFs) towards implementation at their level.”","GHANAP 1

Included in the ""Next Steps"" is the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Committee to assist in monitoring the implementation of the NAP. GHANAP 2 GHANAP 2 states that ""while the overall monitoring and evaluation will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Gender Children and Social Protection, the ME framework has built-in mechanisms at the different levels of implementation which also allows for adjustments to be made in course of implementation based on unforeseen circumstances and emerging opportunities. p 21 GHANAP 1 Ghana's NAP mentions the importance of allocation and material resources towards the implementation of the National Action Plan however there is no specific allocated budget in Ghana's NAP. Indicators The indicators in Ghana's NAP are specified by specific activity. Indicators range from measurable and specific to non-measurable and vague. Example taken from Pillar Three: Prevention Specific Activity: Simplify and translate women's rights and instruments into five main local languages. Indicator: Level of awareness of SGBV and the extent of intolerance for SGBV. Specific Activity: Capacity building and training. Indicator: Number and percentage of SGBV cases reported, investigated and prosecuted. GHANAP 2 The NAP does not mention an estimated budget for the various activities listed. However, it states that the GHANAP 2 will be ""financed using a multi-stakeholder approach including domestic and external sources. The Domestic sources are state and non-state actors operating within Ghana. They include direct Government of Ghana GoG budget funding and funding from private and corporate organizations operating in Ghana. Additionally, it also states that ""MoGCSP in its annual budget will make provisions for adequate funds for the implementation of GHANAP 2. The supporting ministries of Defence, Interior, Finance, Local Government and Foreign Affairs will also budget for their roles in relation to the various aspects of the GHANAP 2 pillars they are committed to. Budgets of the MMDAs will make allocations in the District Assembly Common Fund DACF and their Internally Generated Funds IGFs towards implementation at their level. GHANAP 1 Ghana's NAP is one of the few NAP's with language and actions relating to disarmament. An output objective with specific activities related to disarmament is listed under Pillar Three; Prevention. Output Objective: Promote measures to prevent andor control misuses of illicit small arms and light weapons. Strategies: Advocacy for the domestication of international and continental instruments. Review of firearms and ammunition laws in light of international, regional and sub-regional instruments. Specific Activities: Organize consultative meetings with women groups and female parliamentarians to generate inputs for the review of the firearms and ammunition laws. Organize a consultative meeting with the AG's Office to discuss and develop and roadmap for the review of firearms and ammunition laws from a gender perspectives. Organize a validation workshop with women's groups. Indicators: Extent to which reviewed law reflect gender sensitivity. Existence of a gender-sensitive firearms and ammunition law approved by Parliament. Extent to which reviewed firearms and ammunition law incorporates pro-womengender provisions from international, regional, and sub-regional instruments Primary Stakeholder  Lead Agency: Ministry of Women and Children's Affairs Other Partners: WAANSA; GNACSA; Ministries of Interior and Defense; Parliament; AG Office, MLGRD, Local Government Service GHANAP 2 GHANAP 2 does not include any references or specific action in disarmament which is a step back as GHANAP 1 was considered to be one of the few NAPs that included language and action related to disarmament."

70,Guatemala,7,0,1,64.8,22.7,"Guatemala adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017, but the NAP does not identify a specific period of implementation. The NAP was developed by the Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security (MIMPAZ), which was established in 2012 with the specific goal to promote and facilitate Guatemala'ss implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) resolutions. Guatemala'ss NAP contextualizes the WPS agenda by providing a detailed overview of national and international legal frameworks, focusing on specific developments that propelled the advancement of women'ss rights. The NAP also offers a gender equality analysis of women'ss participation in peace negotiations, executive and legislative bodies, and the security and justice sector in Guatemala. The NAP situates the suggested action items within the country'ss post-war context, highlighting the links between wartime aggression and post-conflict violence perpetrated against women. The NAP'ss overarching objectives lie in mainstreaming gender equality and women'ss rights across the country'ss social and political spectrum. These objectives have corresponding actions and entities responsible for implementation. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include an allocated budget, with each implementing entity held responsible for financing assigned actions. The most recent conflict in Guatemala'ss history is the Guatemalan Civil War, which lasted from 1960 until 1996, leaving 200,000 casualties as well as thousands of disappeared and displaced people. The conflict had a distinct gendered impact on women, with sexual violence used as a weapon of war. Within the context of the war, women began organizing in the 1980s to protest against the killings and disappearance of their loved ones. Women were also actively involved in the peace talks through their advocacy as part of the Women'ss Sector in the Assembly of Civil Society, which was formed to bring civil society recommendations to Track I negotiations. Thanks to the work of diverse women'ss organizations, 11 out of the 13 final accords addressed gender equality and women'ss rights, with five accords including specific provisions on promoting women'ss rights. Nevertheless, only two women were included in the formal peace negotiation delegations. Despite their involvement in the country'ss post-war reconstruction, women in Guatemala are still grappling with the remnants of the war. Increased sexual violence and rape continue to affect women, with indigenous women disproportionately being impacted by rights violations and discrimination. In 2017, two former military officers were convicted with charges of sexual slavery during the war. This landmark proceeding (known as the ""Sepur Zarco case”) led to the recognition of sexual slavery as a crime in a national court for the first time as well as granting reparation measures to the survivors. In 2019, amidst growing national and international pressure, the Guatemalan Congress backed down on passing an amnesty bill, which would have freed military officers convicted of human rights violations. In 2019, Guatemala was among the top 10 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 24% increase in its military spending.",1982,113,2016,344M,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that ""specialized and local civil society organizations that address issues related to the human rights of women in conflict and post-conflict situations, transitional justice, security and justice,” were involved in the development of the NAP during a consultation process in 2013. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Guatemala and therefore was not involved in the development process of Guatemala'ss NAP.
The NAP was developed by Guatemala'ss Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security, which is composed of various governmental bodies (a full list can be found on page 12 of the NAP).  
NAP Implementation
The NAP indicates that the action plan has been designed in a way to ""allow opening spaces with civil society organizations” (p. 14). Additionally, ""creating dialogues with civil society” is mentioned as part of the technical-operational actions for objectives 1 and 4 (pp. 45 and 51-52). However, the NAP does not specify how or which civil society organizations will be involved in the implementation of the NAP. 
The Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security will oversee the overall implementation of the NAP. Additionally, specific governmental bodies are tasked with carrying out specific objectives. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP.
The NAP will be monitored and evaluated by the Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security as well as specific governmental bodies responsible for implementing the NAP. ",The NAP does not identify a specific timeframe for implementation.,"The NAP identifies five objectives (referred to as ""pillars”):
Pillar 1: Empowerment and participation of women
Pillar 2: Training and development of women
Pillar 3: Respect for women's human rights
Pillar 4: Women's leadership for peacebuilding
Pillar 5: Dignified and transformational reparation of human rights violations for women in conflict and post-conflict situations",,"The NAP states that the Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security has ""developed a series of monitoring indicators, linked to global indicators, which will facilitate the regular reporting of these actions to the United Nations Security Council” (p. 6). However, the NAP does not specify what the indicators are.","The NAP mentions the development of a ""system of monitoring and evaluation” (p. 12). However, no monitoring and evaluation plan is included in the NAP.","The NAP indicates that the institutions responsible for carrying out the NAP objectives will allocate a budget for them.

71,Guinea,21,1,1,15.2,,"Guinea adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2009 for the period 2009-2013. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Social Affairs, of Women and Childhood Promotion, but did not include civil society involvement. The NAP identifies five overarching objectives (""priority intervention axes”): integration of gender questionnaire in development policies and programs; involvement of women and girls in the peace process as well as prevention, management, and settlement of conflicts; protection of women and girls from sexual violence and female genital mutilation; strengthening of integration of women in policy decision processes; and strengthening coordination and partnership for stated interventions. These objectives have corresponding actions and an estimated budget, but lack a monitoring and evaluation framework. Guinea reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (pp. 10-11): Development of the 2nd National Action Plan for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and related UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security for the period 2014-2018. A gender and equity unit has been established within the Ministry of National Defense, responsible for monitoring and implementing Resolution 1325. The capacities of the gender and equity department have been strengthened due to the interest generated at the level of the said Ministry in the area of gender; the head of the gender department is solicited in the sub-regional meetings on women and peace. Existence of a national committee to combat the proliferation of small arms and light weapons as part of the fight against arms trafficking. Guinea gained independence from France in 1958, after decades of colonial rule. The country underwent two military coups, in 1984 and 2008. Following the 2009 elections, Guinea experienced political unrest, resulting in the death of protestors as well as the deliberate targeting of women with sexual violence. In 2000, Guinea became home to up to half a million refugees fleeing armed conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia. In December 2013, Guinea witnessed the beginnings of the Ebola outbreak, which spread to neighboring countries as well as having a disproportionate impact on women due to preexisting and long-standing structural and gender inequalities. At the multilateral level, Guinea most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2002-2003.",1982,125,2014,195M,"NAP Development

The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Social Affairs, of Women and Childhood Promotion, but did not include civil society involvement. The NAP identifies five overarching objectives ""priority intervention axes: integration of gender questionnaire in development policies and programs; involvement of women and girls in the peace process as well as prevention, management, and settlement of conflicts; protection of women and girls from sexual violence and female genital mutilation; strengthening of integration of women in policy decision processes; and strengthening coordination and partnership for stated interventions. These objectives have corresponding actions and an estimated budget, but lack a monitoring and evaluation framework. Guinea reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others pp. 10-11: Development of the 2nd National Action Plan for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and related UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security for the period 2014-2018. A gender and equity unit has been established within the Ministry of National Defense, responsible for monitoring and implementing Resolution 1325. The capacities of the gender and equity department have been strengthened due to the interest generated at the level of the said Ministry in the area of gender; the head of the gender department is solicited in the sub-regional meetings on women and peace. Existence of a national committee to combat the proliferation of small arms and light weapons as part of the fight against arms trafficking. Guinea gained independence from France in 1958, after decades of colonial rule. The country underwent two military coups, in 1984 and 2008. Following the 2009 elections, Guinea experienced political unrest, resulting in the death of protestors as well as the deliberate targeting of women with sexual violence. In 2000, Guinea became home to up to half a million refugees fleeing armed conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia. In December 2013, Guinea witnessed the beginnings of the Ebola outbreak, which spread to neighboring countries as well as having a disproportionate impact on women due to preexisting and long-standing structural and gender inequalities. At the multilateral level, Guinea most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2002-2003. The NAP identifies one strategic objective for each of the priority axes identified. For instance, priority axis 1 Integration of gender questionnaire in the development policies and programs identifies the following strategic objective: Include the gender approach in development policies and programs. There are activities listed under the 5 Strategic Objectives in Guinea'ss NAP. Also, these objectives have specific information on budget and activities. Example below: Priority Intervention Axis 3 Protection of womengirls from sexual violence and female genital mutilation Strategic Objective Contribute to the protection of women'ss and girls's rights in terms of sexual violence and female genital mutilation. Activities Organisation of information and awareness campaigns about sexual violence and female genital mutilations; Translation of the 1325 and 1820 resolutions into the main national languages; Mass scale popularization of the 1325 and 1820 resolutions; Creation of a database regarding sexual violence towards women and girls; Strengthening paralegals's, magistrates's, judicial police officers's and care providers's capacities to look after victims of sexual violence and of female genital mutilations; Drafting a specific law regarding sexual violence towards womengirls; Implementation of a consistent mechanism of follow- up and alert; Advocate for cheaper or even free medical care for victims of sexual violence; Strengthening of the capacities of the structures in charge of medical, psychosocial and legal assistance to victims of sexual violence; Advocate for the creation of a national observatory regarding violence towards women and girls; Popularization of emergency kits post exposure to rape victims. The NAP does not specify indicators. Details: There is not much specific information on ME. But, it is described among the activities to create a management and evaluation follow-up database of the 1325 and 1820 resolutions. Each Priority Intervention Axis is presented with a specific budget in Guinea'ss NAP. Example below: Priority Intervention Axis 1 Integration of Gender Each Priority Intervention Axis is presented with a specific budget in Guinea'ss NAP.

78,Iceland,3,1,1,,32.4,"Iceland adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2022. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with some input from civil society. The review of the second NAP by civil society contributed to the third NAP. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda mostly internationally, seeking to implement UNSCR 1325 and coordinate activities related to humanitarian, diplomatic, peacekeeping and development. The NAP is organized around four primary pillars: training and advocacy; participation; prevention, protection, relief and recovery; and partnership and collaboration. Each pillar has corresponding actions and indicators. The NAP does not have an allocated budget. Iceland'ss third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2008 and 2013. The first NAP did not specify a period of implementation while the second NAP was implemented for the period 2013-2016. A key strength of the third NAP is that it continues to recognize partnerships as a separate priority area based on the idea that partnerships have a multiplier effect. The third NAP is more specific than its predecessor but it still mostly has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as responsible for activities. This updated NAP is constructed in the same structure as the previous NAP by consisting of four main pillars, each proposing ideal outcomes, outputs and activities in order to achieve each goal. However, the third NAP joined together prevention, protection, relief and recovery into one objective instead of separate ones as seen in the previous NAP. Finally, the updated NAP, like the two previous ones, does not include any reference to disarmament. Iceland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a key contributor to UN peacekeeping missions, NATO missions, and provider of international aid and humanitarian assistance. Despite being a NATO member , Iceland does not have a military. Iceland has relatively high levels of gender equality and institutional protections for women'ss rights. Currently, women make up approximately 40% of elected representatives in Iceland'ss parliament. Iceland is also a member of the Nordic Women Mediators Network, which was launched in 2015. At the multilateral level, Iceland was a candidate for a non-permanent member seat at the United Nations Security Council for the period 2009-2010, but was not elected.",1985,1,2013,,"NAP Development
Civil society formed part of the development of the NAP  by providing recommendations from the previous NAP.
WILPF does not have a country section in Iceland and therefore was not involved in the development process of Iceland'ss NAP.
The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
NAP Implementation
Civil society is not included as an implementing actor of the updated NAP.
The lead and cooperating implementing agencies are government ministries and institutions.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society, along with the steering group 1325 will be responsible for the mid-term review of the NAP. The mid-term review will assess if the objectives and the time-limits of output and activities apply as well as if amendments to the NAP are needed.
The steering group 1325 is responsible for collecting information from responsible parties for activities outlined in the NAP. The progress reports will then be turned into a summary that will be published by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at the end of every year of implementation. This summary will also be submitted to the parliament yearly.",The fourth NAP is to be implemented in a period of five years 2018-2022.,"Similar to the previous NAP, this NAP has four priority areas.
The four main pillars of the National Action Plan are presented in the following order:
1) Training and advocacy;
2) Participation;
3) Prevention, protection, relief and recovery;
4) Partnership and collaboration.
For each of these four objectives, Iceland's NAP outlines a set of additional ""Outcomes"" or specific objectives. For example, under Participation, they include:
Increased participation of women and subsequent impact on peace and reconstruction, in Iceland and internationally;
Support and training of women in conflict zones which is of use in peace processes and reconstruction at an international level.",,"For each ""Outcome"" there is also a set of indicators. For example, under Prevention, Protection, Relief and Recovery's first outcome - ""Women and girls in conflict-affected situations are protected against violence and will receive relief and recovery"", they give the following indicators:
A course for Icelandic NGOs held twice during the period of validity of the NAP. Estimated cost: 500 thousand Icelandic krona per course.
Percentage of grants/funding provided to Icelandic NGOs' projects that promote and strengthen protection against sexual violence in conflict situations and/or relate to the rehabilitation of victims
Contributions to projects implemented by local NGOs and/or international organisations that focus on the protection of women and support to victims of violence.
Contributions will amount to a minimum of 10 million Icelandic krona per year, including contribution under item 3.2
 ",,The funding of the implementation of the NAP falls primarily on the Defence Directorate and the Directorate for International Development Cooperation of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.,Iceland does not mention disarmament in its revised NAP.,"16-Day Campaign Stop Violence against Women"""": Prevention > Awareness-raising Campaigns

At the multilateral level, Iceland was a candidate for a non-permanent member seat at the United Nations Security Council for the period 2009-2010, but was not elected. Similar to the previous NAP, this NAP has four priority areas. The four main pillars of the National Action Plan are presented in the following order: 1 Training and advocacy; 2 Participation; 3 Prevention, protection, relief and recovery; 4 Partnership and collaboration. For each of these four objectives, Iceland's NAP outlines a set of additional ""Outcomes"" or specific objectives. For example, under Participation, they include: Increased participation of women and subsequent impact on peace and reconstruction, in Iceland and internationally; Support and training of women in conflict zones which is of use in peace processes and reconstruction at an international level. For each ""Outcome"" there is also a set of indicators. For example, under Prevention, Protection, Relief and Recovery's first outcome - ""Women and girls in conflict-affected situations are protected against violence and will receive relief and recovery"", they give the following indicators: A course for Icelandic NGOs held twice during the period of validity of the NAP. Estimated cost: 500 thousand Icelandic krona per course. Percentage of grantsfunding provided to Icelandic NGOs' projects that promote and strengthen protection against sexual violence in conflict situations andor relate to the rehabilitation of victims Contributions to projects implemented by local NGOs andor international organisations that focus on the protection of women and support to victims of violence. Contributions will amount to a minimum of 10 million Icelandic krona per year, including contribution under item 3.2 The funding of the implementation of the NAP falls primarily on the Defence Directorate and the Directorate for International Development Cooperation of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Iceland does not mention disarmament in its revised NAP."

80,Indonesia,9,1,1,,22.4,"Indonesia launched its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2014-2019. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of People'ss Welfare. While the NAP does not indicate civil society involvement, several civil society organizations were involved in the drafting of the NAP as well as being involved in its implementation. The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly domestically, with the goal to protect and empower women and children during conflicts. The NAP has three overarching sections, which focus on preventive programs; resolution programs; and empowerment and participation programs. Each of these sections have specific actions and indicators, but the monitoring and evaluation framework solely consists of meetings to evaluate progress on actions identified in the NAP. Furthermore, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. The most recent armed conflict in Indonesia'ss history is the Aceh conflict, which took place between 1976 and 2005 between the Indonesian government and the pro-independence Free Aceh Movement (known as Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM), which demanded the independence of the Aceh region from Indonesia. The conflict concluded with a peace agreement signed in 2005, but the agreement did not include gender-sensitive provisions. Additionally, the peace agreement called for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission , which held its first public hearing in 2018. Previously, Indonesia occupied Timor-Leste in 1975, with ongoing presence in the country until 2002, when a referendum in Timor-Leste resulted in favor of independence.",1984,85,,7.6B,"NAP Development
The RAN P3A-KS does not include any mention to ""civil society” and thus, it does not mention its participation in the development or implementation. Nonetheless, the Indonesian Government hold consultations with civil society, including women'ss groups, and that the monitoring process is being performed by members of civil society. Civil society - has been actively involved since the drafting process of the NAP in Indonesia, with active groups including: AMAN Indonesia, the Gender Based Violence organisation, and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI).
WILPF does not have a country section in Indonesia and therefore was not involved in the development process of Indonesia'ss NAP.
The development of the RAN P3A-KS was led by the Minister of People'ss Welfare.
NAP Implementation
Civil society organizations are taking concerted action for the NAP implementation at the local level. Local NGOs are coordinating NGO networks at the regional level with aiming to drafting Local Action Plans to make implementation more effective. They work with local government representatives to build capacity and political will for addressing emerging challenges.
On the one hand, the RAN P3A-KS established the Team Coordination Centre as well as the Working Groups to be responsible for NAP implementation in Indonesia. However, there is no mention in the text of the specific actors are involved in these groups. On the other hand, in order to fulfill the goals established in the plan, the following governmental offices are to take the lead in different actions: National Commission on Women Empowerment and Child Protection or KPP PA (Activities coordinator), Indonesian Police,  Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Ministry of Communication & Information, Ministry of Home Affairs, Attorney General Office, National Commission on Child Protection (KPAI),  National Commission for Women, Ministry of Law and Human Rights (Activities coordinator), Ministry of Social Affairs, Indonesian Institute of Science (LIPI), Ministry of Defense, Indonesian Armed Force, Ministry of Development of Disadvantaged Regions, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Public Information Commission, the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI).
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
There is no mention of civil society participation in the monitoring and evaluation process in the NAP.
 According to the NAP, the Central Coordination Team, which is made up with RAN P3A-KS Working Groups in provinces and districts/cities, will coordinate, monitor, evaluate and report the implementation of the NAP - KS P3A to ensure synergy and continuity of the steps of protecting and empowering women and children during conflicts.",The timeframe set for the RAN P3A-KS is from 2014-2019. It is set to be implemented gradually and continuously consisting of a preparation stage by 2014 and an implementation stage in 2015-2019.,"The RAN P3A-KS program consists of series of activities carried out in a systematic and planned manner to protect and empower women as well as children during social conflicts, as an integral part of social conflict resolution activities. In order to do so, the RAN P3A-KS program is divided into 3 sections:
Preventive programs;
Resolution programs;
Empowerment and participation programs.","Every section in the NAP has its own issues to address and the actions that are considered priority in order to do so. For instance, in the first section, ""Preventive programs”, the first issue refers to ""The absence of accurate data and studies on women and children in conflict areas” and the goal set is to ""Provide data and studies on women and children in conflicts areas”. In order to do so, there are two activities set:
Mapping data on women and children in conflicts areas;
Conduct studies of gender-based violence cases from conflicts.","The issues located along the three sections, have different goals, which have their own indicators. In the case of the second section, ""Handling program”, the first issue is ""Incomplete accurate data on women and children who need care in conflict areas” and the goal set is ""Provides data on women and children who need care in conflict areas. In order to achieve it, the indicator set is ""Data on women and children who need care in conflict areas”.","There are three governmental actors that will coordinate the efforts to achieve the goals set. The preventive program coordinator is the Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection, the Handling program coordinator is the National Police, and the Empowerment and Participation program coordinator is the Ministry of Social Affairs.

Moreover, it does not include strategies or mechanisms to ensure activities are funded within departmental budgets.

Iraq adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2014-2018, making it the first country in the MENA region to adopt a NAP. The NAP was developed by the Federal Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government with cooperation between the Ministry of Women'ss Affairs, Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defense in Baghdad and Ministry of Interior and Women'ss High Council in Kurdistan along with the Iraqi NAP 1325 Initiative (I-NAP1325 Initiative), which consists of women'ss rights organizations and networks across Iraq and Kurdistan. The NAP is organized around six pillars: participation; protection and prevention; promotion; social and economic empowerment; legislation and law enforcement; resources mobilization and monitoring and evaluation. Each pillar has a set of objectives, generally aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of women to increase their participation in decision-making spaces as well as raising awareness about the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda. The NAP has an allocated budget, broken down by strategic objectives and corresponding years. Iraq reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, Iraq indicated that the second NAP for the period 2019-2023 is currently being drafted with the support of UN Women and will also include ""the active participation of women in peace and security efforts and the prioritization of their needs in planning, programme development and implementation.” The most recent large-scale armed conflict in Iraq'ss history was the US invasion of Iraq, which lasted from 2003 until 2011, followed by conflict caused by ISIS/Daesh.

83,Ireland,3,1,1,,32.4,"Ireland adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2024. The NAP was developed by a working group that included representatives from the government, civil society, and academia. The NAP takes a holistic approach to the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda, emphasizing the country'ss overarching commitment to advance gender equality in all endeavors and to further examine the gendered impacts of poverty, inequality, climate change, and conflict. In line with this approach, the NAP not only recognizes the need for women'ss meaningful participation in matters pertaining to peace, security, and conflict prevention, but also highlights the need for a root cause analysis that examines gender norms that lead to violence, inequality, and conflict (p. 6). The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and emphasizes the interconnected nature of these two realms. Internationally, the NAP identifies Northern Ireland, Israel/Palestine, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Zimbabwe as key geographical areas to focus on for humanitarian, peacebuilding, and development action. The NAP also promotes an integrated agenda by linking WPS-related actions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite its detailed implementation framework, the NAP does not contain allocated or estimated budget. Ireland'ss third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2011 and 2015 and implemented for the period 2011-2014 and 2015-2018, respectively. Civil society inclusion has been a consistent presence across all NAPs, with an effort to produce the NAP through a participatory approach. Specifically, Ireland'ss third NAP was developed based on the findings and recommendations of the midterm and final reviews of the country'ss second NAP, review of 48 written public consultation submissions, and three public consultation workshops attended by over 100 representatives from civil society, academia, and the government. Ireland'ss three NAPs are similar in their level of detail and areas of focus, with the primary pillars of Resolution 1325–participation; protection; prevention; relief and recovery–adopted as the overarching goals of the NAPs. While the first NAP addresses disarmament through the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts alone, both the second and third NAP expand the disarmament focus with an emphasis on increasing a gender perspective and women'ss inclusion in arms control and non-proliferation. Ireland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but was party to the Good Friday Agreement (1998), which ended a decades-long conflict between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Ireland has a longstanding policy of military neutrality , focused on promoting international peace and stability and refraining from joining military alliances. In line with this policy, the country is not a member of NATO, but is a signatory to NATO'ss Partnership for Peace Program . While Ireland does not export arms, it is engaged in military equipment and technology exports , including equipment used in military aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles.

NAP Implementation
The NAP identifies civil society as a key contributor to the implementation of the WPS Agenda, both domestically and internationally. However, the NAP does not specify how or which civil society organizations will be included in the implementation process.   
The NAP takes a whole-of-government approach to the implementation of the WPS Agenda. As such, multiple government units are tasked with implementing different components of the NAP (p. 12):
The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, who have developed their own action plan on WPS, will continue to build upon their work on the integration of WPS in UN and UN-mandated overseas peace operations;
Units across the Political and Development Cooperation and Africa Divisions in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will implement the plan regionally and internationally, in line with the new A Better World development policy;
The domestic dimension … will be led by the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, and for the first time inputs will be provided by the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Community and Rural Development, and related state agencies.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
An oversight group, appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will monitor the implementation of the NAP. In terms of its composition, fifty percent of the group will comprise government and state representatives and fifty percent will comprise civil society, academia, and independent representatives.

WILPF's Contributions to Ireland's NAP
WILPF submitted input to Ireland'ss development of the third generation NAP on the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda. This submission provided recommendations for Ireland'ss NAP on issues related to disarmament and demilitarization.",The implementation period of the NAP is five years (2019-2024).,"The NAP identifies nine objectives (referred to as ""strategic outcomes”), compiled under the slightly modified four pillars of UNSCR 1325: prevention, participation, protection, and promotion. On Ireland'ss NAP, prevention and participation each have three objectives, protection has two objectives, and promotion has one objective. For example, objective 1.2 listed under prevention is: ""A gender analysis is integrated into Ireland'ss work in conflict-affected contexts and on peace and security issues, including in relation to conflict prevention, peacebuilding and security policy and disarmament” (p. 15).
The NAP has a detailed monitoring framework that breaks down each objective with a corresponding actor, output, specific activities, performance indicators/milestone, implementation year, and department lead. For example, objective 1.2 listed under prevention identifies, ""ensure a whole of department approach to conflict that is gender sensitive” as an output, and identifies ""strengthen capacity and training around gender equality, GBV and gender-sensitive conflict analysis” as an activity (p. 28, monitoring framework). ","The NAP has a detailed monitoring framework that breaks down each objective with a corresponding actor, output, specific activities, performance indicators/milestone, implementation year, and department lead.

For example, objective 1.2 listed under prevention identifies, ""#N of trainings and capacity building that include gender equality, gender sensitive conflict analysis and GBV response training for DFAT staff and partners, including pre-posting training” as an indicator (p. 28, monitoring framework).","Ireland'ss NAP has a multi-tier monitoring and evaluation design, composed of an overarching monitoring framework, an oversight group, two reviews, and state party periodic reporting obligations. The NAP indicates that the monitoring framework will be the ""guiding vehicle through which progress will be measured” (p. 25) on identified objectives. Additionally, an oversight group, appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will monitor the implementation of the NAP. Furthermore, a mid-term review of the NAP will be conducted in 2021 by independent consultants. The findings and recommendations of this review will be used to update the NAP for the remaining two years of its implementation (2022-2024). A final review, which will evaluate the achievements of the first, second, and third NAPs, will be conducted at the end of the third NAP (2024). Finally, the NAP will be integrated into state party periodic reporting obligations under CEDAW and the Universal Periodic Review, which will be coordinated by the oversight group.  ","Despite its detailed implementation framework, the NAP does not contain allocated or estimated budget. The NAP indicates that ""all actions and indicators are mindful of and integrate those from relevant National Policies,” including ""gender budgeting with the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform” (p. 25). Additionally, the NAP identifies allocating ""a dedicated budget to NAP related activities in the areas of monitoring and data collection” (p. 46) as an activity for the objective listed under the promotion pillar. However, there is no specific information on the allocated or estimated budget. Instead, the NAP refers readers to a government website for more information on gender equality budgeting.","The Ireland NAP is infused with the importance of disarmament for promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, and includes a section on disarmament as a tool for conflict prevention. This section highlights the link between the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and the disproportionate impact of weapons (including small arms, light weapons, and nuclear weapons) on women and girls while emphasizing that disarmament and arms control measures ""will contribute to the reduction of GBV and acts as a long-term tool for the prevention of conflict, and the recurrence of violence in the post-conflict phase” (p. 16). 
The NAP also identifies ""prioritizing the inclusion of women and their perspectives in disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation discussions” (p. 9) among the key highlights of the NAP. As such, disarmament is included in one of the objectives listed under the prevention pillar: ""A gender analysis is integrated into Ireland'ss work in conflict-affected contexts and on peace and security issues, including in relation to conflict prevention, peacebuilding and security policy and disarmament” (p. 15). 
Additionally, the NAP identifies furthering ""work in understanding and challenging how harmful masculinities influence policies of disarmament and arms control, including conventional arms control, nuclear deterrence and other justifications for the possession of nuclear weapons” (p. 29) as an activity for objective 1.3 listed under the prevention pillar.

",3,Western Europe,"Ireland adopted its most recent National Action Plan NAP in 2019 for the period 2019-2024. The NAP was developed by a working group that included representatives from the government, civil society, and academia. The NAP takes a holistic approach to the Women, Peace, and Security WPS Agenda, emphasizing the country'ss overarching commitment to advance gender equality in all endeavors and to further examine the gendered impacts of poverty, inequality, climate change, and conflict. In line with this approach, the NAP not only recognizes the need for women'ss meaningful participation in matters pertaining to peace, security, and conflict prevention, but also highlights the need for a root cause analysis that examines gender norms that lead to violence, inequality, and conflict p. 6. The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and emphasizes the interconnected nature of these two realms. Internationally, the NAP identifies Northern Ireland, IsraelPalestine, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Zimbabwe as key geographical areas to focus on for humanitarian, peacebuilding, and development action. The NAP also promotes an integrated agenda by linking WPS-related actions to the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs. Despite its detailed implementation framework, the NAP does not contain allocated or estimated budget. Ireland'ss third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2011 and 2015 and implemented for the period 2011-2014 and 2015-2018, respectively. Civil society inclusion has been a consistent presence across all NAPs, with an effort to produce the NAP through a participatory approach. Specifically, Ireland'ss third NAP was developed based on the findings and recommendations of the midterm and final reviews of the country'ss second NAP, review of 48 written public consultation submissions, and three public consultation workshops attended by over 100 representatives from civil society, academia, and the government. Ireland'ss three NAPs are similar in their level of detail and areas of focus, with the primary pillars of Resolution 1325participation; protection; prevention; relief and recoveryadopted as the overarching goals of the NAPs. While the first NAP addresses disarmament through the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration DDR efforts alone, both the second and third NAP expand the disarmament focus with an emphasis on increasing a gender perspective and women'ss inclusion in arms control and non-proliferation. Ireland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but was party to the Good Friday Agreement 1998, which ended a decades-long conflict between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Ireland has a longstanding policy of military neutrality , focused on promoting international peace and stability and refraining from joining military alliances. In line with this policy, the country is not a member of NATO, but is a signatory to NATO'ss Partnership for Peace Program . While Ireland does not export arms, it is engaged in military equipment and technology exports , including equipment used in military aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. Ireland also contributes to peacekeeping missions and humanitarian operations alongside being a contributor to humanitarian aid. Ireland is a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Ireland is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Ireland currently serves as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2021-2022.

The NAP indicates that ""all actions and indicators are mindful of and integrate those from relevant National Policies, including ""gender budgeting with the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform p. 25. Additionally, the NAP identifies allocating ""a dedicated budget to NAP related activities in the areas of monitoring and data collection p. 46 as an activity for the objective listed under the promotion pillar.

85,Italy,4,1,1,,32.2,"Italy adopted its fourth National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2024. The NAP was developed by the Open-Ended Working Group on Women, Peace and Security of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Human Rights (CIDU) with the input of a variety of stakeholders, including civil society. WILPF Italy participated in the NAP development process. The NAP positions itself within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had disproportionate impacts on women and girls and severely impacted Italy in the beginning of the pandemic. It aims to strengthen existing actions, strengthen an integrated approach, and broaden the scope of WPS actions in line with more recent resolutions and developments in the agenda. Previous NAPs were adopted in 2010, 2014, and 2016, and implemented for the period 2010-2013, 2014-2016, and 2016-2019, respectively. Italy'ss first three NAPs identify the following among their primary goals: increasing the number of women in the military; promoting a gender perspective in peace operations, including training on Resolution 1325; protecting the rights of women, children, and vulnerable groups in conflict and post-conflict zones; strengthening the role of women in peace processes; and increasing civil society participation in implementing Resolution 1325. The NAPs approach the implementation of the WPS agenda both domestically and internationally, with preventing human trafficking and protecting refugees and asylum seekers as major areas of concern at the domestic level. Italy does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but is a contributor to peacekeeping and military operations. In 2019, Italy was also among the top 10 arms exporters in the world. Specifically, between 2015 and 2018, Italy made more than 700 million in euros through arms exports to Saudi Arabia. The Italian government stopped arms exports to Saudia Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as a result of concerted civil society efforts that exposed the human rights violations during the war in Yemen. In 2019, Italy adopted a new law with extended measures to prevent gender-based violence. Despite this positive development for human rights, rights violations continue for migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, including through anti-immigration policies and rhetoric. At the multilateral level, Italy most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for a one-year term in 2017, splitting the ordinarily two-year term with the Netherlands due to a deadlocked election result.",1985,76,2014,26.7B,"NAP Development
The Fourth Italian National Action Plan (2020-2024) was developed through a process led by the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Women, Peace and Security, itself led by the Inter-ministerial Committee for Human Rights (page 9). The development process included a number of virtual meetings that the NAP states included civil society, academia, trade unions, and other actors. These stakeholders are listed in Annex 2 of the Plan.
NAP Implementation and Monitoring
The implementation of the NAP will similarly be conducted through this multi-stakeholder mechanism, including the Working Group, civil society, and other stakeholders. There will be progress reporting that will be conducted with some civil society organizations (page 10). The OEWG is ultimately responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the NAP, and will meet at a minimum every four months. The NAP will also be reviewed on an annual basis in light of emerging issues and agendas and lessons learned. The NAP implementation will be monitored on a consistent basis, including in parliament. 
WILPF
Patrizia Sterpetti, President of WILPF Italia, is cited in the NAP as one of the stakeholders and experts who contributed to developing the Plan. She represented the Section in this role.","The National Action Plan will be implemented for four years, from 2020 to 2024.","The NAP positions itself within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had disproportionate impacts on women and girls and severely impacted Italy in the beginning of the pandemic. It aims to strengthen existing actions, strengthen an integrated approach, and broaden the scope of WPS actions in line with more recent resolutions and developments in the agenda.
The NAP has four stated objectives:
""Objective 1 - Strengthen – on a continuous and lasting basis - the role of women in peace processes and in all decision-making processes, also increasing synergies with civil society, in order to effectively implement UN Security Council Resolution 1325(2000) and the WPS Agenda 
Objective 2 - Continue to promote a gender perspective in peace operations and enhance the presence of women, in particular in the Armed Forces and Polices Forces, strengthening their role in decision-making processes relating to peace-keeping missions and in peace conferences 
Objective 3 – Contribute to promote gender equality, empowerment and protection of women and children, especially girls and boys, as well as respect for human rights of women and children, especially girls, in conflict and post-conflict areas, increasing synergies with civil society, in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1325(2000) and the WPS Agenda 
Objective 4 – Strengthen strategic communication and result-oriented advocacy, by bolstering the Italian participation in relevant fora, conferences and mechanisms (eg UN system, Red Cross, OSCE, NATO, EU, OECD, Council of Europe), to further support the implementation of the WPS Agenda while continuing to ensure the enhancement of information and training at all levels, on the various cross-cutting issues of UNSCR 1325(2000), in particular for the personnel participating in peace operations, including by increasing synergies with civil society and universities, in order to effectively implement UN Security Council Resolution 1325(2000) and the WPS Agenda.”",,"The NAP contains a series of indicators, which have been derived from other relevant frameworks including the UN Secretary-General'ss report on WPS, and the EU approach and plan for WPS implementation
Examples of indicators include ""11. Expenditures and proportion of resources of development cooperation programmes in partner countries as allocated for the WPS Agenda, gender equality, prevention and combat violence against women, peace-building and conflict prevention and N# of CSOs that participate in these programmes”, and 19. N# of women HRD, women peace-builders and women mediators who received support. ","The NAP states that it is envisioned as a 'living document', with the ability to adapt to the changing needs and obstacles experienced in the implementation process. Italy will publish an annual progress report, which will be prepared by the Interministerial Committee on Human Rights (CIDU).","The NAP does not identify a specific number for the budget, but there are numerous indicators that assess progress towards the NAP as being linked to financing. These include:
""9. Proportion of financed projects and initiatives relating to the WPS Agenda, which include relief and recovery programmes.” 
""11. Expenditures and proportion of resources of development cooperation programmes in partner countries as allocated for the WPS Agenda, gender equality, prevention and combat violence against women, peace-building and conflict prevention and N# of CSOs that participate in these programmes.”
""12. Total of expenditures, N# and details about projects that implement support services with regard to SGBV and other forms of violence against women, including information and services in the field of sexual and reproductive health.”","Under Objective 1, there is one action related to disarmament that is listed. This is Action 1.1: ""Promote the direct, formal and meaningful participation of women and youth in peace processes and in all decision-making processes related to peace and security, as well as to international policy, disarmament and development, also in the light of the Youth, Peace and Security Agenda.","Act No. 154/2001 on Measures against Violence in Family Relations: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

Statistics on Violence against Women gathered by the National Network against Violence among Urban Italy Cities"""": Research and statistical data > Other research and statistical data",3,Western Europe,"Italy adopted its fourth National Action Plan NAP in 2020 for the period 2020-2024. The NAP was developed by the Open-Ended Working Group on Women, Peace and Security of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Human Rights CIDU with the input of a variety of stakeholders, including civil society. WILPF Italy participated in the NAP development process. The NAP positions itself within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had disproportionate impacts on women and girls and severely impacted Italy in the beginning of the pandemic. It aims to strengthen existing actions, strengthen an integrated approach, and broaden the scope of WPS actions in line with more recent resolutions and developments in the agenda. Previous NAPs were adopted in 2010, 2014, and 2016, and implemented for the period 2010-2013, 2014-2016, and 2016-2019, respectively. Italy'ss first three NAPs identify the following among their primary goals: increasing the number of women in the military; promoting a gender perspective in peace operations, including training on Resolution 1325; protecting the rights of women, children, and vulnerable groups in conflict and post-conflict zones; strengthening the role of women in peace processes; and increasing civil society participation in implementing Resolution 1325. The NAPs approach the implementation of the WPS agenda both domestically and internationally, with preventing human trafficking and protecting refugees and asylum seekers as major areas of concern at the domestic level. Italy does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but is a contributor to peacekeeping and military operations. In 2019, Italy was also among the top 10 arms exporters in the world. Specifically, between 2015 and 2018, Italy made more than 700 million in euros through arms exports to Saudi Arabia. The Italian government stopped arms exports to Saudia Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as a result of concerted civil society efforts that exposed the human rights violations during the war in Yemen. In 2019, Italy adopted a new law with extended measures to prevent gender-based violence. Despite this positive development for human rights, rights violations continue for migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, including through anti-immigration policies and rhetoric. At the multilateral level, Italy most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for a one-year term in 2017, splitting the ordinarily two-year term with the Netherlands due to a deadlocked election result. The NAP positions itself within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had disproportionate impacts on women and girls and severely impacted Italy in the beginning of the pandemic. It aims to strengthen existing actions, strengthen an integrated approach, and broaden the scope of WPS actions in line with more recent resolutions and developments in the agenda. The NAP has four stated objectives: ""Objective 1 - Strengthen  on a continuous and lasting basis - the role of women in peace processes and in all decision-making processes, also increasing synergies with civil society, in order to effectively implement UN Security Council Resolution 13252000 and the WPS Agenda Objective 2 - Continue to promote a gender perspective in peace operations and enhance the presence of women, in particular in the Armed Forces and Polices Forces, strengthening their role in decision-making processes relating to peace-keeping missions and in peace conferences Objective 3  Contribute to promote gender equality, empowerment and protection of women and children, especially girls and boys, as well as respect for human rights of women and children, especially girls, in conflict and post-conflict areas, increasing synergies with civil society, in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 13252000 and the WPS Agenda Objective 4  Strengthen strategic communication and result-oriented advocacy, by bolstering the Italian participation in relevant fora, conferences and mechanisms eg UN system, Red Cross, OSCE, NATO, EU, OECD, Council of Europe, to further support the implementation of the WPS Agenda while continuing to ensure the enhancement of information and training at all levels, on the various cross-cutting issues of UNSCR 13252000, in particular for the personnel participating in peace operations, including by increasing synergies with civil society and universities, in order to effectively implement UN Security Council Resolution 13252000 and the WPS Agenda. The NAP contains a series of indicators, which have been derived from other relevant frameworks including the UN Secretary-General'ss report on WPS, and the EU approach and plan for WPS implementation Examples of indicators include ""11. Expenditures and proportion of resources of development cooperation programmes in partner countries as allocated for the WPS Agenda, gender equality, prevention and combat violence against women, peace-building and conflict prevention and N of CSOs that participate in these programmes, and 19. N of women HRD, women peace-builders and women mediators who received support. The NAP states that it is envisioned as a 'living document', with the ability to adapt to the changing needs and obstacles experienced in the implementation process. Italy will publish an annual progress report, which will be prepared by the Interministerial Committee on Human Rights CIDU. The NAP does not identify a specific number for the budget, but there are numerous indicators that assess progress towards the NAP as being linked to financing. These include: ""9. Proportion of financed projects and initiatives relating to the WPS Agenda, which include relief and recovery programmes. ""11. Expenditures and proportion of resources of development cooperation programmes in partner countries as allocated for the WPS Agenda, gender equality, prevention and combat violence against women, peace-building and conflict prevention and N of CSOs that participate in these programmes. ""12. Total of expenditures, N and details about projects that implement support services with regard to SGBV and other forms of violence against women, including information and services in the field of sexual and reproductive health. Under Objective 1, there is one action related to disarmament that is listed. This is Action 1.1: ""Promote the direct, formal and meaningful participation of women and youth in peace processes and in all decision-making processes related to peace and security, as well as to international policy, disarmament and development, also in the light of the Youth, Peace and Security Agenda."

87,Japan,4,0,1,,29.2,"Japan adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2023-2028. The 2019-2022 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in coordination with civil society, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in particular with women'ss groups, and experts in the evaluation committee, which monitored and evaluated the first NAP, adopted in 2015 for the period 2015-2018.  The 2019 NAP does not differ drastically from the 2015, rather it focused on smoothing out redundancies.  Structural changes will be reserved for the following NAP based on the experience of implementation. The 2015 and 2019 NAPs approach the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda both domestically and internationally, including reviewing the Japanese government'ss policies and initiatives concerning assistance in the field of conflict prevention and peacebuilding from a gender perspective. The NAP addresses disarmament by highlighting the gendered impact of small arms and light weapons as well as gender-sensitive arms control measures. The NAP'ss objectives are organized under four overarching goals that align with the primary pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation; conflict prevention; protection; and humanitarian and reconstruction. Each specific goal under the pillars is accompanied by a set of actions and indicators; however, the 2019 NAP still does not have a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework despite setting a goal to develop one in the 2015 NAP, nor does it have an allocated budget. Japan has not been involved in armed conflict since the end of World War II, as it adopted a military neutrality policy, which is enshrined in its constitution , that rejects the use of arms as a means to settle international disputes. Nevertheless, the country does have a military force, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF), and has witnessed sporadic, albeit unsuccessful, efforts to revise the pacifist constitution. Additionally, in 2019, Japan was among the top 10 countries with the highest military expenditure. In the current moment, Japan continues to have political tension with North Korea over the latter'ss nuclear programme and with China and South Korea over disputed territory and Japan'ss past wartime actions, including its colonial legacy and the sexual slavery of women, euphemistically refered to as "" comfort women ,” in occupied territories. Japan is a contributor to humanitarian aid, including as a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Japan is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Japan was the UN Women 'ss fourteenth-largest regular resources contributor with USD 3.39 million and the seventh-largest total government contributor with USD 17.65 million. At the multilateral level, Japan most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2016-2017. In Japan'ss constitution, renounce war and ""desire peace for all time”, with the core principle of fundamental human rights, equality under the law and individual dignity.  It also has ‘the essential equality of the sexes in family life's (p 2).  In 1999, Japan enacted the Basic Act for a Gender Equal Society and ​​established the Basic Plan for Gender Equality, which it promotes in tandem with its NAP, with the goal of gender equality a top priority for the 21st century.",1985,121,2014,47.6B,"The analysis in these tabs corresponds to the 2019-2022 NAP.
NAP Development
The 2019-2022 NAP was developed by Japan'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The second NAP reflected recommendations from the evaluation committee (a group of experts), and representatives from civil society and NGOs.
NAP Implementation
Implementation of the NAP will be carried out by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Japan International Cooperation Agency; the Reconstruction Agency; Fire and Disaster Management Agency; National Police Agency; Japan Coast Guard; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; sections of the cabinet office (Gender Equality Bureau, Secretariat of the International Peace Cooperation Headquarters, and Disaster Management).
Civil society will be supported in implementation, but the NAP does not specify any direct involvement.
NAP monitoring and evaluation
Japan'ss NAP does not specify specific bodies for monitoring and evaluation, rather it stipulates ‘All relevant ministries and agencies's (p. 37-39).  It also does not specify which actors will develop the monitoring and evaluation framework.",The implementation period for Japan'ss NAP is three years (2019-2022).,"The NAP is organized into four overarching goals that reflect the pillars of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the WPS agenda more broadly (p. 8).
Participation: Ensuring the equal and meaningful participation of women in all stages in the field of peace and security (including humanitarian relief, defense, diplomatic policies, and peacebuilding processes) with the goal of achieving gender mainstreaming, including introducing gender equality perspectives within decision-making at the national level.
Conflict prevention: Promoting women'ss participation and their active and leading roles in all processes of prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts and in decision-making; strengthening a gender equal perspective. 
Protection: Protect various aid recipients including women and girls from sexual and gender-based violence and other human rights infringements during or after situations of conflict or humanitarian crisis; provide protection and assistance to survivors of this violence. 
Humanitarian relief, recovery and reconstruction assistance: Provide humanitarian relief, recovery and reconstruction assistance which reflect the special needs of women and girls; promote women'ss empowerment and ensure women'ss equal participation within aid assistance providers. ",,"For each action set out under the subset of goals, a set of indicators and the relevant agencies and departments for implementation are listed (p. 9-36).
 For example, the indicators and relevant agencies under Goal 3 under the ‘Conflict Prevention's pillar (‘Promote women'ss participation in conflict resolution, and assist them to take leadership and play active roles, and reflect gender perspective in peace negotiations's) are: 
Train women with advanced conflict resolution skills (negotiation, mediation and arbitration). Indicator: Status of women'ss participation in training for enhancing conflict resolution skills provided at educational institutions in Japan and abroad. Agencies of implementation: Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
Examine and study cases where women significantly contributed to conflict resolution, and extract lessons learned and success factors. Indicator: Implementation status of case studies on conflict resolution and women. Agencies of implementation: MOFA and JICA.
 ","The monitoring report of the implementation status of the Plan will be compiled by the government of Japan, based on the report of the evaluation committee, which will produce an evaluation report every two years. 
The actions set out aim to build a framework to effectively and regularly monitor, evaluate, and review the implementation of the NAP.  The government will review NAP after four years.",No budget has been indicated in the NAP.,"The NAP addresses disarmament by committing to the integration of gender perspectives in small arms and light weapons (SALW) control measures and recognizes the gendered impacts of illegal trade of SALW s in increasing the risk of SGBV in situations of conflict and/or humanitarian crisis.  The NAP sets out to strengthen regulations on the illegal trade of SALW, including through the status of UN resolutions and the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).","Penal Code of 1908: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

88,Jordan,13,1,1,58.2,24.6,"Jordan adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2021 and its most recent NAP for the period 2022-2025. Analysis on the 2022-2025 NAP is forthcoming. The 2018-2021 NAP was developed by the Jordanian National Commission for Women and the National Coalition on UNSCR 1325, which was composed of over 60 representatives from government ministries, civil society organisations, security sector and international partners. The focus of the NAP is to ensure national and regional stability through gender equality and women'ss participation, particularly in national peace and security efforts. These goals are guided by the four pillars of the Women, Peace and Security agenda – participation, protection, prevention, relief and recovery. The NAP grounds the WPS agenda in the country context, highlighting the need for a gender-sensitive approach to humanitarian response; recognising the varying needs of women in humanitarian crises; and emphasizing women'ss agency in the prevention of violent extremism and radicalisation. However, there is no mention of disarmament in the NAP, which challenges further opportunities to deliver on the prevention and participation objectives. The NAP will be monitored and evaluated by all entities that contributed to its creation. In terms of budgeting, there is an inclusion of a national budget allocated for the goals of the NAP to be completed. Jordan reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (p.53): A communication strategy was developed for the National Plan of Action to Raise Awareness and Advocacy for the Women, Peace and Security Agenda for the years 2018-2021 … It was also necessary to clarify the key ideas behind its recommended approach to reach the target groups of outreach activities, particularly key partners outside the capital, to raise awareness and support for the national plan and its objectives. The National Committee for Women, in cooperation with the UN Women, began in 2018 to mobilize resources for the Joint Support Fund through which the activities of the plan will be implemented in the next phase, the estimated total cost of which is estimated at 7,820,000 million dinars for the years 2018-2021. The Canadian, British, Norwegian, Spanish, and Finnish governments pledged to support to the fund for the implementation of the plan, which was launched at a regional conference with international participation in February 2019. Jordan does not have a recent history of armed conflict; however, the country did intervene in military operations outside of its borders, including during the Arab-Israeli War (1948) as well as the Six-Day War (1967). Currently, Jordan is a host country to many refugees fleeing conflicts in other parts of its surrounding region, including from conflicts in Palestine, Syria, and Yemen. In 2019, Jordan was among the top 40 largest importers of arms in the world. Additionally, Jordan was among the top 10 countries globally with the highest military burden (military expenditure as a share of gross domestic product). At the multilateral level, Jordan most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015.",1992,138,2014,2B,"NAP Development
There are several mentions of civil society organisations forming part of the creation of the NAP; however, no specific civil society organisation is included.
WILPF does not have a country section in Jordan and therefore was not involved in the development process of  Jordan'ss NAP.
The NAP notes the role of the various Ministries in the creation of the NAP including the Ministry. Notably, the Jordanian National Commission for Women  contributed to the creation of the NAP as a semi-governmental body.
NAP Implementation
Civil society organisations are included in the implementation of the NAP. For example, for objective 2 on ""meaningful participation of women in preventing radicalisation and violent extremism and in national and regional peace building”, has civil society organisations (CSOs) along with international non-governmental organisations listed as potential actors involved in implementation. 
The framework for implementation of the NAP comprises of several parts because of the different pillars.   Different bodies are in charge of the implementation of different objectives.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The same bodies included in the process of development are included in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP, including civil society.
Government entities will form part of the monitoring and evaluation team through providing reports periodically and ultimately when the NAP ends. For instance, for the pillar pertaining to including women in  the security sector, the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Interior  will be responsible for creating an gendered audit on the Jordanian security sector to assess the work environment for women in the security sector.
Timeframe
The NAP implementation period is four years (2018-2021).",,"By 2021, the commitments of Jordan to Women, Peace and Security will be based on the following objectives:
Gender responsive security sector reform;
Preventing violent extremism and gender responsive peacebuilding;
Gender-sensitive humanitarian services;
Creating a culture of peace and gender equality.","Each pillar has different actions assigned. For example, Pillar 1 ""gender responsiveness and and meaningful participation of women in the security sector and peace operations” includes the following actions: 
Conduct a gender audit across the security sector;
Conduct targeted skills training for women in the security sector;
Participation of military women in educational lectures held by CSO representatives;Increase access to foreign language programmes;
Conduct targeted training to build women'ss leadership and governance skills in the Ministry of Interior;
Promote cross-country collaboration, exchanges of good practices and increase capabilities in  line with international standards  through advanced international field trainings, and technical workshops;
Conduct training for all military personnel of all ranks on UNSCR 1325, subsequent resolutions and gender awareness;
Assess and revise current security sector training curriculums and infrastructure to be gender responsive;
Conduct a nationwide advocacy campaign targeting all governorates to raise awareness of the benefits and importance of women'ss participation in peace and security etc.","To achieve each objective, the NAP has different indicators assigned. For example, Objective 1 on ""gender responsiveness and meaningful participation of women in the security sector and peace operations” includes the following indicators or outcomes:

Analysis on the 2022-2025 NAP is forthcoming. The 2018-2021 NAP was developed by the Jordanian National Commission for Women and the National Coalition on UNSCR 1325, which was composed of over 60 representatives from government ministries, civil society organisations, security sector and international partners. The focus of the NAP is to ensure national and regional stability through gender equality and women'ss participation, particularly in national peace and security efforts. These goals are guided by the four pillars of the Women, Peace and Security agenda  participation, protection, prevention, relief and recovery. The NAP grounds the WPS agenda in the country context, highlighting the need for a gender-sensitive approach to humanitarian response; recognising the varying needs of women in humanitarian crises; and emphasizing women'ss agency in the prevention of violent extremism and radicalisation. However, there is no mention of disarmament in the NAP, which challenges further opportunities to deliver on the prevention and participation objectives. The NAP will be monitored and evaluated by all entities that contributed to its creation. In terms of budgeting, there is an inclusion of a national budget allocated for the goals of the NAP to be completed. Jordan reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others p.53: A communication strategy was developed for the National Plan of Action to Raise Awareness and Advocacy for the Women, Peace and Security Agenda for the years 2018-2021  It was also necessary to clarify the key ideas behind its recommended approach to reach the target groups of outreach activities, particularly key partners outside the capital, to raise awareness and support for the national plan and its objectives. The National Committee for Women, in cooperation with the UN Women, began in 2018 to mobilize resources for the Joint Support Fund through which the activities of the plan will be implemented in the next phase, the estimated total cost of which is estimated at 7,820,000 million dinars for the years 2018-2021. The Canadian, British, Norwegian, Spanish, and Finnish governments pledged to support to the fund for the implementation of the plan, which was launched at a regional conference with international participation in February 2019. Jordan does not have a recent history of armed conflict; however, the country did intervene in military operations outside of its borders, including during the Arab-Israeli War 1948 as well as the Six-Day War 1967. Currently, Jordan is a host country to many refugees fleeing conflicts in other parts of its surrounding region, including from conflicts in Palestine, Syria, and Yemen. In 2019, Jordan was among the top 40 largest importers of arms in the world. Additionally, Jordan was among the top 10 countries globally with the highest military burden military expenditure as a share of gross domestic product. At the multilateral level, Jordan most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015. By 2021, the commitments of Jordan to Women, Peace and Security will be based on the following objectives: Gender responsive security sector reform; Preventing violent extremism and gender responsive peacebuilding; Gender-sensitive humanitarian services; Creating a culture of peace and gender equality. Each pillar has different actions assigned. For example, Pillar 1 ""gender responsiveness and and meaningful participation of women in the security sector and peace operations includes the following actions: Conduct a gender audit across the security sector; Conduct targeted skills training for women in the security sector; Participation of military women in educational lectures held by CSO representatives;Increase access to foreign language programmes; Conduct targeted training to build women'ss leadership and governance skills in the Ministry of Interior; Promote cross-country collaboration, exchanges of good practices and increase capabilities in line with international standards through advanced international field trainings, and technical workshops; Conduct training for all military personnel of all ranks on UNSCR 1325, subsequent resolutions and gender awareness; Assess and revise current security sector training curriculums and infrastructure to be gender responsive; Conduct a nationwide advocacy campaign targeting all governorates to raise awareness of the benefits and importance of women'ss participation in peace and security etc. To achieve each objective, the NAP has different indicators assigned. For example, Objective 1 on ""gender responsiveness and meaningful participation of women in the security sector and peace operations includes the following indicators or outcomes: 1.1 An environment within security sector that is responsive to the security needs and priorities of women, and conducive and favourable for women'ss entry, advancement and leadership. 1.1.1 Obstacles for women to enter, advance and lead in the security sector, and recommendations for how to address these obstacles, are identified. 1.1.2 Steps are taken towards improving the working environment in the security sector to better accommodate the needs of women. 1.1.3 Women and men have increased awareness of the importance of women'ss participation in the security sector, and women are encouraged to engage in the security sector. 1.1.4 Senior leaders demonstrate support for women'ss advancement and candidacy for leadership positions. 1.1.5 Staff within the security sector, especially at the decision-making level, are gender aware, and capable of identifying and responding to harassment and GBV and discrimination within the security sector. 1.1.6 Women are qualified and skilled to advance and reach decision making positions within the security sector. 1.1.7 Institutional capacities within security sector to integrate gender perspectives and to respond to women'ss security needs are strengthened across all security sector institutions.

90,Kenya,23,1,1,64.8,,"Kenya launched its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2024. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Public Service and Gender and the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government. The NAP indicates and acknowledges the involvement of civil society organizations in the NAP development process, but does not specify which civil society actors were a part of the process. The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda both domestically and internationally, and has four overarching objectives that align with the key pillars of the UNSCR 1325: participation; prevention; protection; and relief and recovery. T he NAP addresses disarmament only briefly in the relief and recovery pillar, and through a narrow framework, to incorporate a gender-sensitive design into all disarmament, demobilization, and rehabilitation (DDR) efforts. While the NAP does have a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework, it does not include an allocated budget, instead holding various ministries and bodies at the national and county levels to allocate a part of their budget for the assigned activities. Kenya'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2016 and implemented for the period 2016-2018. The NAP compiles its objectives under four thematic pillars that align with the framework of Resolution 1325: participation and promotion; prevention; protection; relief and recovery. In 2019, Kenya carried out a review of their first NAP to assess the level of implementation, and the findings and recommendations of the review was utilized to inform the development of the second NAP. Specifically, the particular recommendations used for the development of the NAP included the following: deepen the institutionalization of the revised NAP; map out actors implementing the women, peace, and security agenda at all levels; strengthen the awareness and implementation of the NAP at the local level; and develop an effective monitoring and accountability system. Despite the revisions, the second NAP, similar to its predecessor, does not address disarmament beyond the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts. Kenya gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1963, after decades of colonial rule by the British empire. The most recent armed conflict in Kenya'ss history took place after the presidential elections of 2007 and lasted until 2008. During this period of civil and political unrest, over 1,100 people were killed, more than 600,000 people displaced, and at least 900 cases of sexual violence were recorded. Survivors of sexual violence suffered significant physical and psychological trauma and socioeconomic hardship, worsened by the Kenyan government'ss failure to provide measures such as medical care and psychosocial support. The conflict drew national and international attention and prompted the establishment of a Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC). More recently, Kenya has been experiencing further political instability as a result of Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab'ss operations within Kenya'ss boundaries and in neighbouring Somalia. Women'ss security is greatly affected by these attacks by extremist groups alongside the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.",1984,109,,1.148B,"CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS

In 2019, Kenya carried out a review of their first NAP to assess the level of implementation, and the findings and recommendations of the review was utilized to inform the development of the second NAP. Specifically, the particular recommendations used for the development of the NAP included the following: deepen the institutionalization of the revised NAP; map out actors implementing the women, peace, and security agenda at all levels; strengthen the awareness and implementation of the NAP at the local level; and develop an effective monitoring and accountability system. Despite the revisions, the second NAP, similar to its predecessor, does not address disarmament beyond the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration DDR efforts. Kenya gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1963, after decades of colonial rule by the British empire. The most recent armed conflict in Kenya'ss history took place after the presidential elections of 2007 and lasted until 2008. During this period of civil and political unrest, over 1,100 people were killed, more than 600,000 people displaced, and at least 900 cases of sexual violence were recorded. Survivors of sexual violence suffered significant physical and psychological trauma and socioeconomic hardship, worsened by the Kenyan government'ss failure to provide measures such as medical care and psychosocial support. The conflict drew national and international attention and prompted the establishment of a Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission TJRC. More recently, Kenya has been experiencing further political instability as a result of Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab'ss operations within Kenya'ss boundaries and in neighbouring Somalia. Women'ss security is greatly affected by these attacks by extremist groups alongside the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. The critical pillars in KNAP II include: Participation and Promotion; Prevention; Protection; Relief and Recovery. The objectives of these pillars are as follows: To increase the inclusive and effective engagement of women at all decision-making levels in peace, security, and disaster management To enhance the prevention of conflict and all forms of violence against women, girls, and vulnerable groups through gender-sensitive institutional, structural, and social transformation To protect women and girls and other vulnerable groups, including migrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons, in all forms of conflict and violence. To ensure women and girls have the capacity to effectively engage in relief and recovery, and have access to services in humanitarian settings, including periods of disastercrisis Each of the pillars have various outputs which then have interventionsactions assigned. For instance, in pillar 2: prevention, for the output: ""Gender-responsive early warning systems, disaster management, and conflict prevention mechanisms and strategies strengthened, the actions included are: Integrate gender responsiveness into early warning and early response systems and into conflict prevention mechanisms, including the prevention of violent extremism. Conduct research on the use of existing indigenous and traditional knowledge on women'ss roles in early warning and early response. Each of the pillars have various outputs and respective interventions and indicators. For instance, for pillar 3: Protection and the output, ""Laws and policies that protect women'ss and girls's rights strengthened and implemented, the indicators are as follows: Number of laws, policies, and measures adapted and reviewed that protect and promote women'ss and girl'ss human rights in line with regional and international standards Number of measures taken by national and county governments to implement human rights provisions that protect women'ss and girl'ss rights Number of duty bearers and rights holders reached through awareness-raising initiatives on existing laws that protect women'ss and girl'ss rights The NAP includes a detailed plan for the monitoring and evaluation of the actions. The National Steering Technical Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the KNAP II. The committee will also oversee the development and submissions of the quarterly and yearly reports. There is no particular earmarked budget to implement the various interventions stated. However, the NAP states that it is the responsibility of various ministries and bodies at the national and county levels to allocate a part of their budget for the activities. The KNAP II addresses disarmament under the relief and recovery pillar which focuses on incorporating a gender-sensitive design into all disarmament, demobilization, and rehabilitation efforts and peace support initiatives."

93,Kosovo,5,1,1,,,"Kosovo adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2013-2015. The NAP was developed by the Agency on Gender Equality in the Office of the Prime Minister in cooperation with the working group, which consisted of central governmental entities and civil society members, and with the support of UN Women and OHCHR. The NAP identifies its main objectives as the promotion and protection of women'ss human rights as well as the recognition of the victims of the Kosovo War. Additionally, the NAP identifies three outcomes: increased participation of women in decision-making and peacekeeping and building processes; integrated gender perspectives in security affairs and increased women'ss participation in the security structures; and improved access to protection, justice, rehabilitation, and reintegration for survivors of sexual violence, torture, and other forms of violence associated with conflict/war. Each outcome has a set of indicators, as well as a corresponding budget line for estimated costs, but the NAP does not specify how monitoring and evaluation will be carried out. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, although the international recognition of its sovereignty remains contentious. The most recent armed conflict in Kosovo'ss history was the Kosovo War, which lasted from 1998 until 1999 and took place between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Kosovo Liberation Army. Marking the end of a NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999, the United Nations Security Council authorized the establishment of an international civil presence in Kosovo–United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The International Court of Justice ruled that the declaration of independence was in line with international law, and peace talks between Kosovo and Serbia began in 2011 where the EU acted as a mediator. Despite the war'ss disproportionate gendered impacts , women in Kosovo continue to be underrepresented in high-level decision-making spaces related to peace and security.",,,2014,65.7M,"NAP Development
The NAP was drafted through a multi-sectoral and all-inclusive approach which included the participation of  government representatives, representatives of judicial institutions and civil society as members of a working group responsible for the development of the NAP. The members of the working group drafting the NAP  worked alongside, and were supported by, UN Women and OHCHR.
WILPF does not have a country section in Kosovo and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP.
The government of Kosovo started drafting the NAP in 2012 where the Agency on Gender Equality in the Office of the Prime Minister created a working group which started working on the draft.  The working group entailed 28 members and drafted the NAP through a ‘multi-sectoral and all-inclusive approach ensured by the participation of the central institutions of the Republic of Kosovo with senior officials and representatives of the judicial institutions and civil society's. The process was supported by UN Women and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).
NAP Implementation
The NAP is meant to be a flexible and dynamic document to adapted in line with national economic and social changes. The Kosovo Government institutions are the primary actors responsible for its implementation but civil society organisations, including women's groups, are noted as actors who work in a coordinated manner at both a central and a local level where they have made gender issues a priority issue in government policies and programs.
The NAP highlights the Kosovo Women's Network (KWN) consisting of 87 organizations representing women of all ethnic groups and communities in Kosovo. The KWN works on gender-based violence and providing advocacy groups and legal support.
The Working group establishes that the implementation of the NAP requires the coordination of governmental and non-governmental bodies. However, primary responsibility for implementing the NAP does lie with the Kosovo Government institutions.
The NAP was developed following the Kosovo Program for Gender Equality (KPGE)  which was a strategic document defining goals, objectives, policies and actors responsible for implementing gender equality in all fields of social and economic life in Kosovo from  2008 to 2013. The plan included strategic objectives and budgetary costs. The objectives included ‘increased participation of women in decision-making and in processes of building and preserving peace's.
The NAP also notes the role of ‘Gender equality officials's which are appointed to all ministries and municipalities where they are responsible for drafting and implementation policies and activities promoting gender equality. They furthermore oversee the implementation of the Law on Gender Equality and strategic policies for gender equality, such as the KPGE, the Program against domestic violence, the Working Plan for economic empowerment etc.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP will change over the years as a result of lessons learned and challenges during the implementation process which will be set out in evaluation and monitoring reports.
A  coordination and monitoring unit for the implementation of the NAP was set up by Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo, Ms. Mimoza Kusari-Lila when the Agency for Gender Equality was defined as the institution responsible for monitoring the implementation. How the monitoring will take place is not concretely stated in the NAP.
The role of civil society is noted as ‘Civil society organizations have a strong commitment to promoting and monitoring the implementation of Resolution 1325 in Kosovo's. How civil society will assist in the monitoring of the NAP is however not described in detail in the NAP.

To further this objective, the NAP states identifies three main tasks: raising public awareness of gender equality issues and the elimination of gender-based violence, especially in the younger generation; training for the defence and internal affairs sector, including the establishment of a gender adviser position; and transfer of Latvia'ss experience and knowledge. In addition to a brief implementation and monitoring and evaluation plan, the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also has a communications plan to raise public awareness of the NAP and WPS agenda at large through well-known ambassadors in the field. The NAP does not have an allocated budget, but provides a detailed timeline to implement the various tasks identified. Latvia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Latvia does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a member of NATO and has participated in overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions. Latvia has been experiencing ongoing tension with Russia as a result of the latter'ss military activities, including placement of troops and ballistic missiles, in the Baltic Sea Region. Between 2010 and 2019, Latvia increased its military spending by 176 percent. The main aim of the NAP is to ""develop and improve coordinated actions for the maintenance of peace and security at the international and national levels taking into account the principles of gender equality. The NAP mentions the following sub-objectives to be implemented: Purposeful and coordinated activities in the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in international organizations and formats. Raising public awareness of Women, Peace and Security and reducing gender-based violence. Educating the new generation and raising awareness of gender equality and the prevention of gender-based violence. Capacity building of the Defence and Internal Affairs sector on gender issues. Promoting the exchange of knowledge and experience on the UNSC Resolution in the framework of bilateral and multilateral development cooperation The NAP lists three main tasksactivities to be implemented: 1 raising public awareness of gender equality issues and the elimination of gender-based violence, especially in the younger generation; 2 training for the Defence and Internal Affairs sector, including the establishment of a gender adviser'ss position; and 3 transfer of Latvia'ss experience and knowledge. Each of these tasks have a number of events listed under them. For instance, for the first task, these are the events: International conference on Women, Peace and Security and the prevention of gender-based violence Reflection of gender issues and the elimination of gender-based violence in the teaching process of schools offering a general education Gender mainstreaming and human rights in youth work and nonformal education Exhibition about women  girls in the NAF and the National Guard and other thematic exhibitions Engaging Latvian Embassies and Missions on the topic of Women, Peace and Security and in promoting the National Action Plan Implementation of the Communication Plan on Women, Peace and Security, promotion of the topic and the National Action Plan both on social media and media, as well as at national-level events and in international organizations Establishment of a contact point network of persons  institutions involved in the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda Each of the lines of actions have a list of performance indicators. For instance, for the line of action ""Training on gender equality and the prevention of gender-based violence; creation of a gender adviser position in the Latvian defence and internal affairs sector, the indicators are: 5 training cycles in the Latvian Defence and Internal Affairs sector in the period from 2020 to 2025 3 gender adviser positions in the Latvian Defence sector and 1 gender adviser position in the Latvian Internal Affairs sector in the period from 2020 to 2025. Regarding the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP, the document states that, ""a new inter-ministerial working group headed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall be established to evaluate the National Action Plan. Working group meetings will be convened when necessary. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will prepare and submit a mid-term evaluation of the National Action Plan to the Cabinet of Ministers by 1 December 2024, and information on the implementation of the National Action Plan by 1 March 2026, ensuring the possibility of a seamless transition from one period of the plan to the next. There is no earmarked budget to implement the NAP; however, the document states that the NAP will be implemented within the budget of the responsible institutions. The NAP does not mention disarmament issues or have any specific commitments to implement the same."

100,Liberia,27,1,1,58.8,,"Liberia adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2023. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection through a participatory approach that included consultations with key line ministries, agencies and commissions, civil society organizations, women'ss groups, youth groups, media, and international partners. The NAP is constructed on five main pillars, reflective of the key pillars of UNSCR 1325: prevention, protection, participation, relief and recovery, and coordination and accountability. Each of these pillars have dedicated outcomes, outputs, indicators and activities, which support the following goals: women and girls's safety, physical and mental health and security are assured and are fully protected under legislation and policies that promote their empowerment and full participation at all levels, in building sustainable and inclusive peace and security in Liberia. The NAP includes a detailed monitoring and implementation plan as well as an allocated budget. Liberia'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2009 and implemented for the period 2009-2013. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender and Development in consultation with civil society actors. The NAP'ss objectives are compiled under four thematic pillars: protection; prevention; participation and empowerment; and promotion. Each pillar has corresponding strategic issues, priority areas, outputs, and indicators; nevertheless, these actions do not have allocated funds. Liberia'ss second NAP follows a similar thematic structure, compiling the overall objectives under five pillars: prevention; protection; participation; relief and recovery; and coordination and accountability. The NAP also includes a standalone section on lessons learned from the implementation of the first NAP and provides a more substantive engagement with contextualizing the WPS agenda within the historical and political framework of Liberia. The second NAP'ss monitoring and evaluation mechanism is more detailed as well, specifically through the inclusion of timeframes and an allocated budget for each outlined activity. Liberia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others: With a goal of ‘a more peaceful, unified society that enables economic transformation and sustainable development's, the Government of Liberia is committed to compliance with human rights obligations as per treaties acceded. It has set national targets in the Social Cohesion and Reconciliation (SCORE)6 index to increase civic trust and co- existence from 52% to 70% and to reduce the index for violent tendencies from 19% to 5%. (p. 12) The Peace Hut initiative was established after the civil war and during the first term of former President H.E Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, providing a safe space for women in rural communities to discuss issues that plague them especially relating to conflict resolution. There are over 36 Peace Huts established across the country … At the Peace Huts women mediate problems, run projects and businesses, and advocate for women'ss rights. (p. 39) The Ministry of Gender Children and Social Protection with support from UN Women, provided training for 47 female candidates in campaign strategies; message development, mapping, debating and public speaking. Also, 25 women were trained from September 25-28, 2017 in Gbarnga, Bong County, to serve as election observers in 25 selected districts across the country. The training was in collaboration with the Women Peace and Security Institute, with funding from Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center. As an outcome of the Colloquium, a Leadership building platform through Mentorship was established for young women and youth. In this light the Ministry will be training 30 young leaders in leadership skills under the Theme: Unleashing the Leadership in Young Women and Youth. Currently, women comprise 12.3% in the House of Representatives and make up 10.0% in the Senate. The Government of Liberia, as a High National Level Target in the PAPD (2018-2023), has committed to increasing the political participation of women at the national and local levels to reach a target of 30% by 2023. In addition, prior to the passage of the Liberian Local Government Act in 2018, the Government implemented the Liberia Decentralization Support Program which provided training for women and girls leadership to participate in local governance. The Local Government Act is also gender sensitive as it exclusively provides 2 out of 7 members local assembly seats for women. In turn, women can compete for the remaining 5 seats. (p. 75) The most recent armed conflict in Liberia'ss history was the two civil wars, which took place from 1989-1997 and 1999-2003. The United Nations Mission in Liberia ( UNMIL ) was established in 2003 to support the implementation of the ceasefire and peace process, and departed in 2018, after 15 years in the country. Women have played a key role in Liberia'ss peace and reconciliation efforts, in particular through the establishment of the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace. Women'ss active campaigning led to the signing of the Accra Peace Agreement in 2003. While women were excluded from mediator and signatory roles, they represented 17% of witnesses. Additionally, the agreement had multiple provisions addressing women'ss rights.",1984,97,2015,17M,"NAP Development
Civil society organizations (CSOs) were involved in the NAP development process, in particular, they participated in the following consultations: 1) Two awareness-raising workshops in May 2019 to raise awareness about UNSCR 1325 and promote leadership, ownership and participation of local communities; 2) Two-day monitoring and evaluation (M&E) workshop in May 2019 to review the NAP logical framework, implementing structure and cost activities.
Additionally, civil society members were also part of the 1325 working group that developed the new implementation structure for the NAP. 
The lead agent in the development of Liberia'ss NAP was the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MGCSP). However, representatives of the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Youth and Sports also participated in the NAP development process.
NAP Implementation 
The implementation structure (pg 23) presents the various interlinked implementing bodies and lays out their roles and responsibilities (annex, pg 48 onwards). The National Steering Committee (NSC), Technical Working Group (TWG), Monitoring and Evaluation Learning Unit (M& EL Unit), County Task Forces, and District Champions, are responsible for implementing the NAP at various levels and have civil society and women'ss groups representatives as their members. 
Government Ministries and Agencies are involved in all the NAP'ss implementation and coordination structure. All implementing bodies will report to the President of Liberia. For instance, the National Steering Committee (NSC) will be  ""co-chaired by the Minister of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MGCSP), the Minister of Justice (MoJ) and Minister of Defence (MoD)” (pg 48). The Technical Working Group (TWG) will be ""co-chaired by the Deputy Minister of the Department of Gender at the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection and the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning”. The TWG also has ""Gender focal points of each government Ministry involved in LNAP WPS implementation” (pg 50). 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society members are part of the NAP'ss M&EL Unit, which plays a crucial role in the development of a detailed M & EL plan (pg 24). In the overall Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Framework of the NAP, CSOs are represented at the district, county, TWG and NSC levels.
The M&EL Unit primarily responsible for the NAP'ss M & E will be co-chaired by senior representatives of the MGCSP'ss M&E Unit and a senior representative of the Liberia Institute of Statistics Geo-Information Services (pg 51). The unit will also have M & E focal points from all ministries, representatives from the Governance Commission and the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services.","The NAP is implemented from 2019 to 2023. It is expected to undergo a mid-term (December 2021) review and final evaluation (December 2023). Under each pillar of the NAP, the respective outcomes and indicators mention a particular timeline to achieve targets and activities. 
For instance, In pillar 1 of the NAP i.e, Prevention, under the output ""Legal and constitutional reforms to promote security of women, young women and girls enacted” one of the targets is to train 200 legislators, 200 government officials and 50 members from parliamentary committees, staff from the legislative drafting bureau ""to develop, amend and implement legislation and policies in line with gender and human rights standards disaggregated by age, sex and region” (pg 26) by 2023. ","The Liberian NAP is constructed on five pillars: Prevention, Protection, Participation, Relief and recovery, and coordination and accountability. These pillars address the government'ss priority regarding WPS agenda and are aligned with ""national policies and strategies, namely the PAPD, the revised National Action Plan on GBV (NAPGBV) 2018-2023, and the NGP (2018-2022) amongst others.”
For example: Pillar 3 i.e., Participation has the following outcomes and outputs (pg 36). 
Outcome 3: Effective participation and leadership of women, young women, disabled and rural women at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding, peacekeeping, conflict management and resolution and countering terrorism
Output 3.1: Implementation of measures to ensure women'ss, young women'ss and girls's political participation and leadership in elections, political parties, constitutional and legislative processes
Output 3.2.: Laws and strategies regulating SSIs and the extent to which they promote participation and leadership of women and young women in these institutions are reviewed and appropriate actions taken
Output 3.3.: Women'ss and young women'ss participation and leadership in SSIs including armed forces, police forces and UN peacekeeping forces, promoted.
Output 3.4.: Women'ss inclusion and participation in the justice sector, including the legislature and judiciary, promoted
Output 3.5.: Strengthened ability of women and young women leaders, women'ss rights advocates, and CSO representatives to foster women'ss leadership roles in peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, mediation and negotiations and countering terrorism
Output 3.6.: Greater participation of women, young women, disabled and rural women in peacebuilding and conflict management and resolution processes, including national dialogues and transitional justice","Under each pillar, the NAP lists activities that will be implemented to achieve its overall goal, these activities will be mainly conducted through line ministries as part of their ongoing plans. 
For instance, In pillar 4. Relief and recovery, to strengthen integration of gender perspectives into relief, recovery and peacebuilding intervention, following were the activities stated (pg 41): 
National Disaster Management Agency of Liberia (NDMA) to integrate gender analysis into all post-disaster planning tools and processes; ensure recovery efforts provide equal economic opportunities for women including access to assets, such as land and credit; promote social protection, and sustainable livelihoods, prioritize women'ss needs in key sectors such as transportation, shelter and health care, during and after disasters. 
NDMA to incorporate gender analysis in the assessment of disaster risks, impacts and needs; address women'ss unique needs and value women'ss knowledge in disaster reduction and recovery policies, plans and programmes; strengthen women'ss networks and organizations to facilitate women'ss active engagement. 
NDMA to provide capacity building for all relevant actors to mainstream gender in all Humanitarian/crisis response planning, frameworks and programming
In addition to indicating the activities for each output and indicator, the NAP also lists the budget, timeline and responsible parties that will carry out these activities.","Each pillar of the Liberian NAP has a set of outcomes, outputs and indicators dedicated to it.  
For example, under Pillar 5: Coordination and accountability, to increase coordination, implementation, reporting and accountability on Liberia'ss second NAP (pg 44), indicators are: 
Liberia'ss second phase NAP endorsed by the MGCSP and all other responsible parties and implemented
Annual Report on NAP implementation presented by President to the legislature","The NAP Monitoring and Evaluation Learning Unit (M&EL Unit) plays a crucial role in developing a detailed  M&EL plan and is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the overall implementation of the NAP.  At the national level the M&EL Unit reports annually to the President and Legislature. At the county level, the NAP county task forces report to the M&EL unit and they track and record progress of NAP activities at county level. At the district level, the district task force reports to the county task force and tracks and records progress of NAP activities from clans, chiefdoms, DAC officers and Town Advisory Councils. ","The NAP estimates the costs to carry out activities under the five pillars. For instance, in pillar 2 of the NAP i.e. Protection, the Ministry of Health and Social Services is responsible for providing ""necessary equipment and training for all MCH facility staff on GBV protocol for addressing health care needs (especially MCH needs) of survivors of SGBV”, which is estimated to cost USD 200,000 for 2020 to 2023 (pg 33).  
""The NAP was costed using a genderresponsive budgeting (GRB) approach, as part of a two-day workshop that reviewed the NAP logical framework, including baseline, targets, data sources, responsible institutions and timeline information. Participants included government, CSOs, women'ss groups, youth groups and media professionals” (pg 25). 
Note on Liberia'ss first NAP budget: ""No government funding was dedicated to NAP implementation and international funds were committed to support the Ministry of Gender and Development (MoGD) and coordination, but not to support activities. The lack of resources led to insufficiently trained staff and activities left incomplete or never started at all.”",The NAP does not refer to or address disarmament issues and arms proliferation as a risk to the national implementation of the UNSCR 1325.,"Article 12 of the Constitution: Laws > Violence against women > Constitutional provision

103,Lithuania,5,1,1,,32.7,"Lithuania adopted its second National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020, for the period 2020-2024.​​ According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania , the 2020-2024 NAP ""aims to strengthen women'ss role in the building of peace and to promote their participation in security and democratic processes at the national and international levels”, taking into account prior implementation of WPS at the national and regional levels. The development of the NAP considered the experience gained over twenty years of the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, the conclusions of the Council of the European Union (EU) on Women, Peace and Security, and the provisions of the EU Action Plan regarding the Women, Peace and Security Agenda 2019-2024.  It contains objectives, targets, activities, expected results and an allocated budget. It will be implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of National Defence, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Ministry of Health, and the Police Department under the Ministry of the Interior, and will be monitored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Lithuania adopted its first NAP in 2011, which identified three overarching objectives: increase the participation of women in conflict prevention as well as military and civilian operations and missions; raise awareness about UNSCR 1325 among Lithunian society and educate the personnel of pertinent institutions; contribute to international initiatives to implement UNSCR 1325, specifically on women'ss security and protection of women'ss rights. Lithuania reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). The 2020 NAP approaches the implementation of Women, Peace and Security and gender equality at both the domestic and international levels.  It changes the focus of national action somewhat from 2015, encompassed by four overarching goals: to promote women'ss leadership in international peace processes; to promote gender equality; to intensify international cooperation for the Agenda issues; to advise state institutions, non-governmental organizations on the issues of the Agenda, to raise public awareness. Each objective has corresponding goals, actions, responsible actors, a broad implementation timetable and allocated budget. The 2020 NAP does not have a monitoring and evaluation framework specified. Lithuania gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. The country does not have a recent history of armed conflict; nevertheless, Lithuania has been experiencing ongoing tension with Russia as a result of the latter'ss military activities, including placement of troops and ballistic missiles, in the Baltic Sea Region.  Between 2010 and 2019, Lithuania increased its military spending by 232 percent. Lithuania is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. At the multilateral level, Lithuania most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015.",1994,33,2014,1.084B,"NAP Development
The 2020-2024 NAP was developed by Lithuania'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  
The NAP does not specify civil society involvement during the development process.
NAP Implementation
The NAP will be implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of National Defence; the Ministry of the Interior; the Ministry of Social Security and Labour; the Ministry of Health (Institute of Hygiene); and the Police Department under the Ministry of the Interior.
NAP monitoring and evaluation
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will monitor the implementation of the NAP. ",The implementation period for Lithuania'ss NAP is five years (2020-2024).,"The NAP is organized into four overarching goals (called tasks) (p. 8)
 Promote women leadership in international peace processes: this task addresses the inclusion of women in peace operations and missions, in institutions, and as diplomats and peace mediators
To promote gender equality: this task includes increasing knowledge of mechanisms that prevent, combat and handle violence, sexual exploitation, abuse, and gender-based harassment and violence, including institution staff and soldiers; also preparing a report on Availability of Healthcare for Women and Girls who Have Experienced Domestic Violence. 
To intensify international cooperation for the issues of the Agenda: this task includes agenda-setting within the OSCE, EU, NATO and other high-ranking multilateral meetings, knowledge-sharing and attending expert meetings on the WPS agenda.
To advise state institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on the issues of the Agenda, to raise public awareness: this task includes agenda-setting for trainings for EU missions, international operations, diplomatic missions etc.; training civil servants and soldiers; researching the role of gender in different socioeconomic environments during conflict; supporting NGOs with WPS competence and dissemination of information.","The NAP breaks each of the four overarching tasks into specific actions, called measures, along with the period of implementation in years (p. 3-9).
 For example, task 2 of ‘To promote gender equality's encompasses four measures including:
‘To evaluate the possibility of appointing gender advisers in the Ministry of National Defence and/or other institutions of the national defence system and, if possible, establishing positions for gender advisers in these institutions's (p. 4)'s
Timeline: 2020-2024
‘To inform soldiers and staff at national defence institutions on how to contribute to the fight against all forms of violence against women, including sexual exploitation, violence, and harassment, especially in the event of a crisis, threat, or conflict.'s (p. 5)
Timeline: 2020-2024","Each measure set out under the broader tasks has an indicator of implementation called ‘Results to be achieved's.  They are broad, and mostly qualitative indicators.  The relevant implementing authorities are also included (p. 3-9).
For example, Task 1 of ‘Promote women leadership in international peace processes's includes measure ‘1.5. To train and consult potential peace mediators on Agenda topics and to strengthen their skills's.  
Result to be achieved: ‘At least 3 potential peace mediators trained's (p. 4)
Implementing authorities: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ","Although the NAP indicates that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will monitor its implementation, no framework for monitoring and evaluation was included, nor was an action or measure to formulate one.","The NAP stipulates that ""The Action Plan shall be implemented with the appropriations from the state budget of the Republic of Lithuania allocated to the responsible executors” (p. 1).  The measures are allocated an appropriation (in EUR) per year per executor, as necessary.  For instance, under Task 1 ""Promote women leadership in international peace processes”, the measure ""1.4 To make a list of potential peace mediators” has no budget allocated.  Measure ‘4.4 Depending on the authority, to help non-governmental organizations develop competence on Agenda issues, to disseminate information, and to promote participation in international forums's has an appropriation of €1000 per year each for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Social Security and Labour.",Lithuania's NAP does not address disarmament nor the gendered impacts of weapons such as small arms.,"Allocation of Funds to NGOs for Prevention of Demestic Violence: Budgets > Government allocation

For the development of the plan, the Office of the President, Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, and UN Women convened in several meetings to scope out the process. NAPs from selected countries in the Africa Region were reviewed to draw lessons from them. Four stakeholders's consultative workshops were held in the Northern, Central, Eastern and Southern regions to develop goal, objectives and priority areas and key interventions. Consultative workshops were held in five districts known for conflicts which were purposefully selected to get perspectives of the refugees, asylum seekers, and others. 
The actors in charge of the process of development of the NAP are the Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, Cooperating Partners, local and international NGOs, the Office of the President, and the Cabinet. This task force was developed with the objective to speed the process towards implementing the Action Plan and to enhance realization of Women, Peace and Security on all levels. The National Task Force harnessed technical and thematic expertise from various stakeholders involved in peace and security policies and initiatives throughout the country, in alignment with the National Peace Architecture (NPA). For the development of the plan, the Office of the President, Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, UN Women convened in several meetings to scope out the process. In this process, NAPs from selected countries in the Africa Region were reviewed to draw lessons from them. Four stakeholders consultative workshops were held in the Northern, Central, Eastern and Southern regions to develop goal, objectives and priority areas and key interventions. Consultative workshops were held in five districts which were purposefully selected to incorporate the perspectives of the refugees, asylum seekers, and others. 
Implementation 
The Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare is the institution responsible for the promotion of gender equality in national development and the empowerment of women in Malawi. This Ministry provides overall coordination of the NAP. It will work in collaboration with the Malawi Peace Commission, the Ministry responsible for Civic Education and National Unity. In addition, there will be an independent national coordinating body to ensure the implementation of the NAP.
Monitoring and Evaluation 
For monitoring and evaluation, Malawi appointed the Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare as well as the Malawi Peace Commission to coordinate the implementation of the NAP. A national coordinating body also is involved in the process of ensuring collaborative engagements between these entities and follow up on the implementation. ",The timeframe of the NAP is 2021-2025.,"Malawi has formulated its NAP around three strategic areas: an integrated response to violence against women and girls, promotion of economic empowerment, and strengthening of the enabling environment for the effective and sustainable implementation of global commitments on WPS at the national level. The NAP is intended to stimulate focused interventions from various stakeholders and interest groups. Malawi seeks to materialize UNSCR 1325 initiatives at the country level with the support of continental and global efforts on WPS.
The NAP also has six general objectives:
Enhance accountability and implementation of international and national frameworks on Women, Peace and Security 
Mainstream gender in Women, Peace and Security structures, strategies and processes
Capacitate state and non-state institutions at all levels to enable them to advance WPS agenda effectively
Increase the participation of women and girls in decision-making structures in peacebuilding processes 
Prevent and effectively respond to violence against women and girls
Protect women and girls in conflict and non-conflict and humanitarian situations.","The NAP outlines a range of actions, which include:
Put in place interventions and measures for increased women'ss and girls's participation at all levels of decision-making in conflict management and peace interventions, including participation in various institutions and platforms at national, regional and international level. 
Create and support platforms that carry out interventions and provide services for the protection of women and girls from sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and gender-based violence in conflict, refugee camps and other disaster and humanitarian contexts. 
Ensure relief and recovery measures and other humanitarian crises are addressed through gendered lens, while taking deliberate account of the needs of women and girls when designing programmes and settlements for displaced persons during the time of disasters and other humanitarian crises. 
Support the implementation of Gender Related Laws to ensure increased participation 
Train women in district peace committees on WPS and leadership 
Mobilize women and girls and support their adult literacy and numeracy education to enable them to participate in decision-making platforms
Support the implementation of Gender Related Laws to enhance protection of women and girls 
Strengthen mechanisms that facilitate provision of psychosocial support to victims of disasters and conflict situations","The NAP details the goals and actions for each of the pillars that serve as the foundation of the Project Document, and there is information about the key expected results of each activity. Further, the NAP situates itself within an analysis of the current state of implementation of WPS within Malawi, and indicates which key elements are present or not present within the country's national policies and programming, as indicators for the current level of WPS mainstreaming. ","There will be a monitoring and evaluation plan in place for data collection and reporting on the project indicators. The data will include national surveys, and progress reports submitted by institutions and organizations that implement some of the NAP activities. There will be quarterly and annual reports, as well as a mid-term review of the NAP.","The NAP has an implementation plan which includes an overall budget for each of the key interventions regarding the priority area or pillar it belongs to. For example, a key intervention is to implement Gender related laws to ensure increased women'ss participation. This priority area is accompanied by other key activities and for this section, the nation has allocated USD 1,352,000.

109,Mali,18,0,1,5.3,18.8,"Mali adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2023. The NAP'ss theory of change (pgs. 22-23) centers women'ss participation in peacebuilding, reconciliation processes, and in post-conflict governance and identifies concrete outcomes and associated actions. Mali'ss third NAP builds on lessons learned from the previous plan, consultations at all levels, and research on Women, Peace and Security agenda implementation. It has a number of key changes from the previous plan (pgs. 20-21), which include: Updated contextual analysis; Alignment with international, regional, and national instruments; Two results frameworks (a strategic framework and an operational plan); Longer duration; Ownership and broad leadership; Improved coordination, monitoring, and budgetary mechanism; and Localization. The 2019-2023 NAP includes emerging issues including radicalization and violent extremism; displacement; the role of men in advancing gender equality, and climate change. The NAP contains a situational analysis of the previous NAPs, and reports on progress from the 2015-2017 NAP in order to provide context for the new plan. The NAP includes an operational plan, and notes that details are subject to change; the NAP will be updated yearly and as required (pg. 6). There is a national budget for implementation, which is supplemented by another fund to finance stakeholder implementation. Mali'ss third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2012 and 2015 and implemented for the period 2012-2014 and 2015-2017, respectively. Mali reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, Mali indicated that the priorities of the third NAP include: the prevention of conflicts and gender-based violence, protection and rehabilitation of victims, participation and representation of women in decision-making bodies, promotion of gender and women'ss empowerment, and coordination, monitoring, and evaluation (p. 35). Additionally, Mali reported that there is low representation of women in the monitoring of the peace, security and reconciliation process. The average representation of women in the implementation mechanisms of the peace agreement is around 3% (p. 33). Mali gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule by the French Empire. Mali has experienced ongoing political instability since its independence, with multiple military coups in 1968, 1991, 2012, and 2020, including extended rule by a military junta from 1969 until 1979. Furthermore, Mali experienced two armed conflicts with Burkina Faso, resulting from a recurring border dispute in 1974-1975 and 1985. Most recently, in 2012, Mali experienced conflict with Islamic and Tuareg insurgent groups, leading to instability in the northern parts of the country. A UN peacekeeping mission, MINUSMA, has been active in Mali since 2013. At the multilateral level, Mali most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2001-2002.",1985,139,2013,474M,"Development 
The NAP development process was led by the Ministry for the Advancement of Women, Children, and Families (MPFEF) and various stakeholders from public and community institutions, civil society, media, and other partners were involved (pg. 6).
NAP Implementation and Monitoring and Evaluation
The National Monitoring Committee for NAP 1325 is the party that is primarily responsible for the implementation of the NAP (pg. 6) under the direction of the Ministry for the Advancement of Women, Children, and Families (MPFEF). This committee is part of a broader coordination and monitoring mechanism (pg. 24) that also includes the Support Steering Committee and the Technical Management Unit. Implementation will also include representatives from 15 ministries, the National Assembly, government programs, CSOs, the UN, technical and financial partners, and the implementation mechanisms of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation. The list of members of the National Monitoring Committee is available on pg. 25. It will meet every quarter to discuss results and progress on the NAP. The Support Steering Committee is responsible for resource mobilization (pg. 24), and the Technical Management Unit is responsible for coordination, communication, monitoring and evaluation, and management of dedicated resources.
The NAP states that consultations with civil society were organized as part of NAP development, and that a Community of Practice will be maintained for the purpose of learning and implementation. There is a NAP indicator for civil society'ss level of participation in the process.",The timeframe for NAP implementation is 2019-2023.,"The overall goal of the NAP is to incorporate gender into legislative, institutional, and structural reforms, focusing on women'ss participation in peacebuilding and reconciliation processes and in post-conflict governance (pg. 7). 
There are four main priorities in the NAP:
Participation: Women are fairly and actively involved in peacebuilding and reconciliation processes, and hold decision-making positions at all levels of governance.
Prevention: Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) arising during conflicts are prevented and women make a significant contribution to conflict prevention and other threats to human security.
Protection: The fundamental rights of women and girls throughout all phases of conflicts and in times of peace are respected, protected and promoted, and their human security is ensured.
Relief and Recovery: Women and girls are agents of change. Their specific needs and strategic interests are taken into account and their human security is ensured in crisis and reconstruction situations.
The NAP is aligned with national and international policy frameworks. On the national level, it is aligned with the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, as well as policies including those on combating SALW proliferation, gender, GBV, and sustainable development. Internationally and regionally, it aligns with AU, ECOWAS, and G5 Sahel commitments, and the SDGs.","Under the strategic framework, there are a number of results and associated indicators under each of the priority areas of the NAP. 
Under the priority of participation, result 1.2 of the NAP states that ""Women are involved in mediation; negotiation; conflict management; forums for peace, security and social cohesion; in communities; and at the national, sub regional and international level.” Another result under prevention is 2.1 ""All forms of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls are better prevented”. 
There are also sub-activities, labeled opportunities, associated with each activity. For example, under result 2.3, there are sub-activities 2.3.1 ""The implementation of the National Policy for preventing and combating violent extremism and terrorism takes gender into account” and 2.3.2 ""The social, cultural, political, religious and economic causes for violent extremism and terrorism are identified and analyzed through the lens of gender.”","There are a number of indicators associated with the results framework. For example: Under the result  2.1 ""All forms of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls are better prevented”, indicators include ""Changing the attitudes of girls, boys, women, and men in the face of SGBV” and sub-indicators under more specific results include ""Number of men and boys engage in the fight to end all forms of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence”.
NAP indicators are aligned with other global and national indicators, including those for the SDGs and for 1325 implementation.","There is a monitoring and evaluation framework detailed in the NAP (pg. 26) which includes details on the monitoring mechanism and knowledge management. The monitoring mechanism will meet quarterly, and there will be annual reporting on the NAP. Based on results and the context in Mali, there will be recommendations and changes made to the NAP.
The NAP provides detail on the progress made towards the previous NAPs, including the statistic that 50% of actions from the 2015-2017 NAP were successfully completed, as well as additional actions not included in the draft. It also provides good detail on the challenges faced in implementation, including ownership, emerging issues, and top-down decentralization of commitments.","Details about the NAP budget are provided (pg. 28); specifically, there is a dedicated budget for implementation and a mutual fund to finance other stakeholders's implementation. This fund is co-managed by the MPLEL and UN Women. Some of the financing is provided by the government of Mali and other financing is from international donors. ","The NAP states that two of the frameworks that were taken into account in the development of the NAP were the National strategy for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of ex-combatants (DDR) (2018) and the National Action Plan to Combat the Proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons in Mali (2014-2018). 
In addition to references to weapons in relation to DDR and in conflict prevention, including with regards to masculinity and gender roles, there are concrete actions on disarmament. Result 3.5 is ""The safety of women and girls in the face of trafficking and small arms and light weapons circulation is improved”, with the indicator ""Proportion of weapons seized, found or voluntarily returned, the illicit source or use of which has been traced or established by competent authorities, in accordance with international instruments”. Opportunity 3.5.1 is ""Legislation related to small arms and light weapons is updated and aligned with international and regional instruments and takes gender into account”, with the indicator ""How much the gender perspective is taken into account in legislation relating to small arms and light weapons.","Enqute Dmographique et de Sant des indicateurs des VBG: Research and statistical data > Violence against women module in survey

At the multilateral level, Mali most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2001-2002. The overall goal of the NAP is to incorporate gender into legislative, institutional, and structural reforms, focusing on women'ss participation in peacebuilding and reconciliation processes and in post-conflict governance pg. 7. There are four main priorities in the NAP: Participation: Women are fairly and actively involved in peacebuilding and reconciliation processes, and hold decision-making positions at all levels of governance. Prevention: Sexual and gender-based violence SGBV arising during conflicts are prevented and women make a significant contribution to conflict prevention and other threats to human security. Protection: The fundamental rights of women and girls throughout all phases of conflicts and in times of peace are respected, protected and promoted, and their human security is ensured. Relief and Recovery: Women and girls are agents of change. Their specific needs and strategic interests are taken into account and their human security is ensured in crisis and reconstruction situations. The NAP is aligned with national and international policy frameworks. On the national level, it is aligned with the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, as well as policies including those on combating SALW proliferation, gender, GBV, and sustainable development. Internationally and regionally, it aligns with AU, ECOWAS, and G5 Sahel commitments, and the SDGs. Under the strategic framework, there are a number of results and associated indicators under each of the priority areas of the NAP. Under the priority of participation, result 1.2 of the NAP states that ""Women are involved in mediation; negotiation; conflict management; forums for peace, security and social cohesion; in communities; and at the national, sub regional and international level. Another result under prevention is 2.1 ""All forms of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls are better prevented. There are also sub-activities, labeled opportunities, associated with each activity. For example, under result 2.3, there are sub-activities 2.3.1 ""The implementation of the National Policy for preventing and combating violent extremism and terrorism takes gender into account and 2.3.2 ""The social, cultural, political, religious and economic causes for violent extremism and terrorism are identified and analyzed through the lens of gender. There are a number of indicators associated with the results framework. For example: Under the result 2.1 ""All forms of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls are better prevented, indicators include ""Changing the attitudes of girls, boys, women, and men in the face of SGBV and sub-indicators under more specific results include ""Number of men and boys engage in the fight to end all forms of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence. NAP indicators are aligned with other global and national indicators, including those for the SDGs and for 1325 implementation. There is a monitoring and evaluation framework detailed in the NAP pg. 26 which includes details on the monitoring mechanism and knowledge management. The monitoring mechanism will meet quarterly, and there will be annual reporting on the NAP. Based on results and the context in Mali, there will be recommendations and changes made to the NAP. The NAP provides detail on the progress made towards the previous NAPs, including the statistic that 50 of actions from the 2015-2017 NAP were successfully completed, as well as additional actions not included in the draft. It also provides good detail on the challenges faced in implementation, including ownership, emerging issues, and top-down decentralization of commitments. Details about the NAP budget are provided pg. 28; specifically, there is a dedicated budget for implementation and a mutual fund to finance other stakeholders's implementation. This fund is co-managed by the MPLEL and UN Women. Some of the financing is provided by the government of Mali and other financing is from international donors. The NAP states that two of the frameworks that were taken into account in the development of the NAP were the National strategy for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of ex-combatants DDR 2018 and the National Action Plan to Combat the Proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons in Mali 2014-2018. In addition to references to weapons in relation to DDR and in conflict prevention, including with regards to masculinity and gender roles, there are concrete actions on disarmament. Result 3.5 is ""The safety of women and girls in the face of trafficking and small arms and light weapons circulation is improved, with the indicator ""Proportion of weapons seized, found or voluntarily returned, the illicit source or use of which has been traced or established by competent authorities, in accordance with international instruments. Opportunity 3.5.1 is ""Legislation related to small arms and light weapons is updated and aligned with international and regional instruments and takes gender into account, with the indicator ""How much the gender perspective is taken into account in legislation relating to small arms and light weapons."
110,Malta,4,1,1,,,"Malta adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2024. The NAP was developed by the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs (MFEA). The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in the NAP development process. Malta'ss NAP builds on the country'ss development and gender policies and is structured around four pillars, aligned with a modified version of the key pillars of UNSCR 1325: promotion, prevention, participation and partnership. Each of these pillars have various objectives, actions, indicators, along with implementation periods and responsible actors. The NAP also outlines a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan and states that the identified actions will be implemented in partnership with various government ministries and civil society.

The 2018 NAP was developed by a number of ministries, including the Ministries of Defense; Health, Labor and Social Protection; and Internal Affairs, through a participatory approach that included a series of dialogues, roundtables and meetings to increase the level of awareness of public authorities and civil society with the provisions of Resolution 1325. The NAP mentions civil society involvement in all stages of NAP development, implementation, and monitoring, with objective 6 specifically mentioning strengthening the involvement of civil society in the decisions taken by the security and defense systems. The NAP is primarily focused on women'ss participation in the security and defense sectors and outlines eight key objectives, developed with the goal to increase women'ss representation in the security and defense sectors. While identified objectives are tied to specific actions as well as a monitoring framework, the NAP does not have an allocated budget. Moldova reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (p. 5): The Republic of Moldova has improved the public policy framework on gender equality and in other related fields. Important strategic policy documents were adopted and their implementation commenced: 2017-2021 National Gender Equality Strategy, 2018-2023 National Strategy on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, 2018-2023 National Strategy for Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, National Action Plan on implementation of the provisions of the UNSCR 1325 Women in Peace and Security 2018-2022, as well as other sectorial strategies (health, employment, social protection, security, child protection, etc.).

This denotes positive developments in achieving gender equality and promoting women. However, despite these achievements, the analysis of the situation in the Republic of Moldova on the issue of gender equality and promotion of women highlights that the biggest challenges during 2014-2019 were: empowering women in the political, economic, and social areas; work and family life reconciliation; domestic violence; and the specific situation of certain groups of disadvantaged women (Roma women, women from rural areas, women living with HIV, women in detention, migrant women, etc.).

NAP Development
Civil society formed part of the development of the NAP in partnership with government institutions.

The NAP was developed with different ministries such as the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Protection, Ministry of Internal Affairs.
NAP Implementation
In order to ensure an inclusive and transparent process of implementation of the National Program and Action Plan, the Reintegration Policy Bureau will create a group of implementing partners.

Along with the aforementioned ministries, central authorities will be responsible for accomplishing their objectives within the deadlines outlined in the NAP and submit necessary information to the responsible entities for creating reports on the implementation of each action, annually until January 5th. They are responsible for integrating the provisions from the NAP  into annual action plans, monitoring and reporting on progress and implementation difficulties on a regular basis, and designating a person responsible for coordinating this process.

The NAP was developed by a number of government entities, including the Ministries of Defense; Interior; and Foreign Affairs. The NAP does not mention civil society involvement in the NAP development process. The NAP is mostly oriented towards ensuring women'ss participation in the security sector at the local (police force), national (armed forces) and international (peacekeeping) levels. It also addresses the issue of human trafficking in Montenegro and provides mechanisms to address it regionally and internationally as well as protecting women and girls from discrimination and gender-based violence. The NAP specifies, under each objective and activity, a responsible entity for achieving the tasks identified and provides indicators to measure their implementation. While relevant ministries and donors are responsible for funding the NAP, there is no specific budget attached to the NAP. Montenegro reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (pp. 50-51): Reporting on the implementation of the Action Plan is regular and is carried out on an annual basis. The Ministry of Defence and the Army of Montenegro are the bearers of responsibility for 20 activities, out of which 17 activities are already implemented, one activity is on-going and two activities have not been implemented. In February 2019, the draft of the new Action Plan with the Implementation Program 2019- 2020 has been made and it is in the process of adoption. The Committee for Gender Equality of the Montenegrin Parliament, at the joint sessions with the Committee for Security and Defence, examines reports on the implementation of the Action Plan for the Implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security in Montenegro, defining measures and activities to integrate gender equality issues in the processes of defence system reform and at all levels in which decisions are made and policies are created and implemented. The Committee has, in the previous period, organized an International Conference ""Cetinje Parliamentary Forum: Women, Peace and Security” with the aim of implementing and understanding Resolution 1325 and its accompanying resolutions (R1820, R1888 and R1889) as well as exchanging regional and international experiences when it comes to women'ss participation in the security system and the definition of future activities in this field and the continuation of good regional cooperation between parliaments and governments, as well as with the non-governmental sector. Montenegro became an independent state in 2006, after a referendum that resulted in the country'ss peaceful separation from Serbia, both of whom were previously part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

For the purpose of monitoring and implementation, the NAP requires the creation of an  Inter-Agency Working Group and the establishment of an Ad-Hoc Parliamentary Group.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation

The NAP includes priority actions to be implemented by state institutions, civil society and cooperation partners in the context of women'ss participation in conflict management and resolution; assistance for displaced and refugee women; the prevention of violence and sexual abuse; and post-conflict reconstruction. The NAP keeps women'ss and girls's human rights in conflict and post-conflict at the forefront of its focus, with the goal to integrate a gender perspective in all actions and strategies on conflict prevention and management; expand efforts for the security, physical and mental health dignity of women and girls; and secure the rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations. Furthermore, the NAP includes an allocated budget, broken down by priority sections. Mozambique reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975, after ten years of liberation efforts, and experienced a civil war that ended in 1992 with the signing of the Rome General Peace Accords. Mozambique continues to experience the negative social, political, and economic impacts of the war, which had a distinct gendered impact of women, specifically through the usage of sexual violence as a weapon of war. Furthermore, women survivors of the civil war continue to suffer from the traumatic effects of their experiences, silenced and given no right to reparations. Despite the negative impacts of the war, women also played a role as peacebuilders and activists, in particular through assisting victims of armed conflict.",1991,56,2018,137M,"NAP Development
There is no mention of civil society forming part of the creation of the NAP.
WILPF was not involved in the development of the NAP.
The NAP was launched by the Gender, Children and Social Welfare Ministry in partnership with UNWomen and the Governments of Iceland and Norway and was created along with the 2015-2019 five-year Government Programme that aims to improve the well-being of Mozambicans, consolidate national unity, peace and sovereignty.
NAP Implementation
Civil society will have access to the indicators of the NAP for the implementation and will submit and analytical report every year. They will also participate in the joint annual meeting.
Multiple Government bodies are responsible for the implementation of the NAP such as the Gender, Children and Social Welfare Ministry, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Ministry of Interior, among others.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society is also responsible for monitoring the NAP and will require access to the indicators to do so. This access is important because civil society are equally as responsible as the government for monitoring the NAP. Based on annual reports from civil society and governmental bodies, there will be a final report with both perspectives included. This will turn into one final report through a Monitoring and Evaluation Committee.",The implementation period for the Mozambican National Plan of Action is five years (2018-2022).,"The five primary objectives of Mozambique'ss NAP are focused on:
Creating a favourable environment for the implementation of the legislation on women, peace and security;
Integrating a gender perspective in all actions and strategies on conflict prevention and management;
Guaranteeing the participation of women in decision making structures in peace and security processes;
Promoting mechanisms to secure increased recruitment, retention and promotion of women in defence and security, and justice bodies;
Reinforcing the fight against all forms of violence against women and girls in armed and non-armed conflict contexts.",,"Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, the first objective  on policy and legal framework on women, peace and security include several indicators of which different entities are responsible for such as. For instance, for the following objectives, the Ministry of Gender, Child, and Social Action, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, as well as all key sectors are responsible:
Greater representation and participation of involved sectors in group meetings;
Number of staff in key sectors trained on women, peace and security issues;
Number of UNSC resolutions and other legislation on women, peace and security ratified and implemented in the country.","The monitoring and evaluation framework incorporates an annual report  based on the indicators outlined. This was was developed after careful consultations with civil society, non-governmental and governmental actors. Monitoring will be done from the perspectives of civil society and government bodies, through a Monitoring and Evaluation Committee. The committee should present two annual reports, one from civil society and one from governmental bodies, and hold two alignment and extraordinary semi-annual meetings. The final report will include both perspectives.","The NAP has an allocated budget with a total of 116, 835, 00 MZM.

122,Namibia,16,1,1,,30.3,"Namibia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2024. The NAP was developed by a National Task Team, which consisted of several ministries and UN technical advisors. Civil society organizations were included in the development process of the NAP through consultative meetings. Namibia'ss NAP builds on the country'ss National Gender Policy, developed for the 2010-2020 period. The NAP is also seen as complementary to the other mechanisms and frameworks developed to advance women'ss rights in Namibia. The overarching goal of the NAP is to create ""a safe and peaceful Namibia where all women, men, girls and boys have equal rights and live without fear or want and in dignity” (p. 16). The NAP includes a detailed implementation matrix, which includes an allocated budget. Namibia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (pp. 62-63): Namibia has aligned its outcome indicators to the AU Continental Results framework where relevant. Progress on the implementation of the Action Plan will be monitored annually to look at the challenges faced by stakeholders in the implementation of the Action Plan; proposals of possible solutions to these challenges; and documenting successes and planning for possible replication. Gender equality is an important tenet of Namibia'ss Foreign Policy, and as a result, in 2016, Namibia, together with Spain, Canada, Chile, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates launched the Global Focal Points Network, in recognition that national and regional efforts are vital for the full and effective implementation of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda. In 2018, Namibia successfully inscribed Women, Peace and Security as a standalone agenda item at the last meeting of the Ministerial Committee of the Organ of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The result of this is that SADC member states are now required to report to SADC about their national activities and policies as they relate to the effective implementation of the WPS Agenda. The National Development Plan (NDP5), the Harambee Prosperity Plan, (2015), The National Gender Policy (2010-2020) and National Plan of Action on Gender- Based Violence (2012-2016) are all frameworks that address gender equality, gender mainstreaming and the protection of women. Namibia gained independence from South Africa in 1990. The most recent armed conflict in the country'ss history is the Caprivi Conflict , which lasted from 1994 until 1999 and took place between the Namibian government and the secessionist Caprivi Liberation Army. The conflict displaced thousands of people, who took refuge in the neighboring Botswana. At the multilateral level, Namibia most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 1999-2000. The Council adopted Resolution 1325, the landmark resolution of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda, under the Presidency of Namibia on 31 October 2000.",1992,12,2014,410M,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that civil society organizations were included in the development process of the NAP through consultative meetings. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Namibia and therefore was not involved in the development process of Namibia'ss NAP.
The NAP was developed by a National Task Team, which consisted of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare, Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation, and UN technical advisors. The Ministry of Defense chaired the team while the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare, Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation acted as co-chairs. Additionally, the NAP development process also entailed consultative meetings with multiple stakeholders, including government ministries, security sector institutions, traditional authorities, the military, women'ss organisations, faith-based organisations, civil society, and youth organisations. 
NAP Implementation
The NAP identifies civil society organizations as among the key actors of several strategic objectives. For example, strategic objective #1 (To mainstream a gender perspective in security sector legislation) lists ""relevant civil society institutions” as among the key actors. However, the NAP does not further specify which organizations will be a part of the implementation. 
Multiple ministries are tasked with implementing the NAP on the implementation matrix alongside other actors, such as civil society organizations and regional councils. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP does not indicate civil society inclusion in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP.
The NAP indicates that the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NAP. ",The implementation period of the NAP is five years (2019-2024).,"The NAP identifies 10 objectives (referred to as ""priority areas”), compiled under the four pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation, prevention, protection, and relief and recovery. On Namibia'ss NAP, participation has three objectives, prevention has three objectives, protection has two objectives, and relief and recovery has two objectives listed. Each priority area has its own strategic objectives. For example, priority area #2 listed under participation is: ""Participation of women in peace and security structures” (p. 19). Strategic objective #1 for this priority area is: ""To mainstream a gender perspective in security sector legislation” (p.19, implementation matrix).",,"The NAP identifies several indicators, both qualitative and quantitative, for each objective, outlined in the implementation matrix. For example, strategic objective #1 listed under participation identifies, ""Number of legislation reviewed and updated” and ""Existence of gender inclusive reviews and directives” as indicators and means of verification (p. 19, implementation matrix). ","The NAP indicates that the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NAP and that implementation will be monitored annually. Additionally, the document states that the NAP ""will be accompanied by a monitoring and evaluation plan, to be used by different stakeholders” and that all actors responsible for implementing the NAP will need to report on their activities (p. 32). However, the NAP does not specify when or how the plan will be developed or made available.

125,Netherlands,5,1,1,,32.4,"The Netherlands adopted its fourth National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2021-2025. The fourth NAP states that its main vision is ""a world of sustainable peace, security and development for all, where equal participation of women and girls is self-evident.” It has five strategic outcomes, which correlate to the four main pillars of the WPS agenda and also prioritize gender mainstreaming. The fourth Dutch National Action Plan was developed through a consultative process with a range of actors, including ministries such as the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Justice and Security, and Education, Science, and Culture, and the police service. Additionally, over 60 civil society organisations participated. All of these actors together are part of the Dutch NAP partnership. The fourth NAP is preceded by three others, for the periods 2016-2019, 2012-2015, and 2008-2011. The second, third, and fourth NAPs both have standalone sections that provide an overview of the implementation of the previous action plans as well as ""lessons learned” for the revised NAP. The third NAP, for instance, states that the Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the body responsible body for evaluating the implementation of the NAP, found out that ""the NAPs have not provided guidance … on how to translate the resolution'ss objectives into actions that are responsive to contextual gender realities” (p. 21). As such, the third NAP aims to strengthen its gender-specific analysis as well as monitoring and evaluation mechanism. All four NAPs approach the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly internationally. The first three NAPs approach disarmament through the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts, and the fourth NAP has an objective of implementing Article 7.4 of the Arms Trade Treaty. The Netherlands does not have a recent history of conflict, but plays a large role in international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. The Netherlands is a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. The Netherlands is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2016, the Dutch parliament passed a bill to halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia, over concerns about violations of humanitarian law in Yemen. In 2019, the Netherlands was among the top 15 arms exporters in the world. At the multilateral level, the Netherlands most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for a one-year term in 2017, splitting the ordinarily two-year term with Italy due to a deadlocked election result.",1991,38,2014,12B,"The fourth Dutch National Action Plan was developed through a consultative process with a range of actors, including ministries such as the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Justice and Security, and Education, Science, and Culture, and the police service. Additionally, over 60 civil society organisations participated. All of these actors together are part of the Dutch NAP partnership. The full list of NAP partners is available here.
All partners involved in the NAP have a responsibility to report on its implementation. Government bodies ""have an institutional obligation to report to the UN on their contribution to implementing Resolution 1325, the 10 successive WPS resolutions and CEDAW, as well as to the EU on the EU Action Plan on WPS. They are also responsible for annual reports to the House of Representatives.” Civil society organizations also have an M&E obligation to provide insight into their implementation efforts.
WILPF Netherlands is one of the partners of the National Action Plan, and is listed as such on the partner website. ",The NAP will be implemented from 2021 to 2025.,"The NAP states that its main vision is ""a world of sustainable peace, security and development for all, where equal participation of women and girls is self-evident.”
It has five strategic outcomes, which correlate to the four main pillars of the WPS agenda and also prioritize gender mainstreaming. These are:
(1) Participation: more women hold leadership positions, and women participate equally and meaningfully in decision-making processes at every level in the interests of peace and security, including conflict prevention and resolution, peacebuilding, protection, relief, reconstruction and recovery.
(2) Prevention: conflict prevention and the prevention of violent extremism, including of related violence against women and girls, is based on the human rights approach and starts from the principle of human security. Prevention policy and its implementation are conflict-sensitive, gender-sensitive, gender-responsive and gender-transformative.
(3) Protection: women and girls, as well as men and boys, in and from conflict situations, are protected against all forms of conflict-related violence, including sexual and gender-based violence. Their rights are safeguarded and enforceable.
(4) Relief, reconstruction and recovery: relief, reconstruction and recovery meet the needs and contribute to the empowerment and human security of women and girls.
(5) WPS mainstreaming: a gender lens is applied to every reorganisation, improvement, development and evaluation of analysis, policy and policy implementation with regard to peace and security.",,"There are numerous indicators in the NAP which correlate to the strategic outcomes. These are both qualitative and quantitative, incorporating various methods to assess progress towards the NAP. They are correlated with responsible actors and modes of implementation.
Under Strategic outcome 1 on participation, examples of indicators are:
Examples of women reporting improved meaningful participation in decisionmaking (through self-assessments and storytelling)
# of times that civil society organisations (CSOs) or community leaders have succeeded in creating space for CSO demands and positions on women'ss meaningful and equal participation and leadership in conflict prevention, peacebuilding and state-building, and protecting women'ss and girls's rights in crisis, conflict and post-conflict situations, through agenda setting, influence on debates and/or movement-building
# of Dutch government initiatives to engage, support and protect women'ss rights organisations (WROs), women human rights defenders (WHRDs) and peace builders in country analysis and peace processes","The fourth Dutch NAP has a monitoring, evaluation, accountability, and learning framework (pg 40). Within the NAP it states that this framework will be improved and refined (if necessary) over the course of implementation from 2021-2025.
The framework states that all partners are jointly responsible for implementation, and have made commitments to one or more outcomes/sub-outcomes. There will be annual reporting, for which there is joint responsibility. This annual reporting will help strengthen learning for better results. The NAP states that there will be bi-annual events, learning events, country and thematic groups, webinars, newsletters, a website, and a Twitter account.
To help facilitate M&E, there are baseline 2020 figures for many of the indicators of the NAP; where these do not exist there will be reporting in 2021. The NAP will attempt to disaggregate data.
There will be an independent evaluation of the NAP in 2025.","Although a specific figure for a budget is not indicated in the NAP, a standalone WPS budget does exist and is referenced in the NAP, as well as prior impacts of earmarked financing. There are several indicators that are specifically related to financing in terms of evaluating the NAP. These include:
Total Dutch expenditure on the WPS agenda, including both the stand-alone WPS
budget and WPS mainstreaming
Proportion of funding allocated to CSOs that has been spent on WPS in conflict affected
Countries","The international context of the NAP links weapons to women'ss insecurity, stating that ""Increased militarisation, the steady spread of small arms and light weapons, the development of new weapons and the lack of a gender lens in the security and justice sector have for decades now been exacerbating conflicts, gender inequality and conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence” (pg. 60). The Arms Trade Treaty is listed (pg. 9) one of the international obligations that have strengthened commitment to the WPS agenda. 
One area of action for the NAP will be the implementation of article 7.4 of the Arms Trade Treaty, with regards to the potential impacts of the Dutch arms trade on GBV (pg. 27). The NAP states that the Netherlands will ""monitor where Dutch arms export or transit leads to an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence. We also work to gather and publish sex and age disaggregated data (SADD) as part of national crime and health statistics, including data on victims of armed violence and conflicts.

126,New Zealand,4,1,1,,,"New Zealand adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015 for the period 2015-2019. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in coordination with the New Zealand Defence Force, New Zealand Police, and the Ministry for Women. The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in the NAP development process. The NAP identifies four overarching objectives that align with the primary pillars of UNSCR 1325: prevention, participation, protection, and peace, relief, and recovery. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda mostly internationally, identifying WPS actions in a number of conflict-affected countries, including Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. Additionally, the NAP has the goal to improve international deployment rates of senior staff within the New Zealand Defense Force and New Zealand Police as well as to increase the numbers of women at decision-making levels in peacekeeping and assistance missions. While the NAP'ss objectives have corresponding actions and indicators, the NAP does not have an allocated budget. New Zealand reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). New Zealand does not have a recent history of conflict, but it was involved in overseas military operations, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. The New Zealand Special Air Service (SAS) faced allegations of war crimes, including torture, committed during Operation Burnham , a joint operation undertaken in 2010 in Afghanistan. The New Zealand government initiated an official inquiry to address the allegations in 2018, which resulted in the delivery of four overarching recommendations , including establishing an office of the Independent Inspector-General of Defence ""to facilitate oversight over the New Zealand Defense Force and enhance its democratic accountability” (p. 33). In 2019, New Zealand was among the top 15 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 19% increase in its military spending.

NZDF and NZ Police will include information on violations of women'ss and girls's human rights that occur during participation in UNSC-mandated peacekeeping missions, international assistance missions and other peacekeeping operations in their periodic reporting, according to mandate.
NZDF and NZ Police will be responsive to and investigate any violations of the rights of women and girls that occur during participation in UNSC mandated peacekeeping missions, international assistance missions and other peacekeeping operations, in line with relevant international standards.
Where a credible allegation of the commission of a crime during a peacekeeping operation is raised by the United Nations against a New Zealander, New Zealand will inform the United Nations of the progress of the investigation and prosecution process.","Each of the actions that are set for each of the fundamental objectives, include indicators. For instance, the first action of the second fundamental objective, ""Participation”, sets that: ""New Zealand will advocate at international fora to increase the quantity and seniority of women'ss representation in national and United Nations-led peace processes.” The indicator established for this action is the following: ""number and type of statements made and recorded”.","New Zealand agencies will establish a gender-balanced inter-agency Women, Peace and Security Advisory Group, to professionalise New Zealand'ss responses to women, peace and security issues and to guide and monitor implementation and reporting under this National Action Plan.

128,Niger,13,1,0,,17.2,"Niger adopted its second National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2020-2024. This NAP follows a previous one, adopted in 2016 for the period 2016-2018. Analysis of the 2020-2024 NAP is forthcoming. The 2016-2018 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Population, Women'ss Empowerment and Child Protection, through a participatory approach that included consultations with civil society organisations, NGOs, and technical and financial partners. The NAP focuses on four priority axes, including: prevention of conflict and gender-based violence; protection, assistance and rehabilitation of victims; participation and representation; coordination, monitoring and evaluation of activities. However, the NAP, while referencing the impact of armed conflict on women, does not offer any specific actions for disarmament and arms control, including monitoring mechanisms for assessing the impact of arms proliferation on sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). While the NAP offers financing specifics as well as a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework, it does not have a timeline. Niger reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the report indicates that Niger supported the establishment of the G5 Sahel Women'ss Platform and the development of a three-year action plan for 2019-2021 (p. 37). Niger gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule. The country experienced military rule and rebellions, including a military coup in 2010, leading to widespread social and political instability, including lack of access to natural resources; lack of access to public resources, including the redistribution of income from extractive industries; a demographic dividend and marginalisation of women and youth; weak governance, social tensions and the recurrence of political and institutional instability; armed conflicts, including armed rebellions in the northern part of the country. Additionally, socio-political turmoil in Libya, armed conflict in Mali, the presence of Boko Haram and the presence of terrorist groups in the north-west have all led to displacement throughout Niger and an influx of migrants. Most recently, in 2020, Niger received thousands of migrants and asylum seekers, who were expelled by Algeria.",1999,,2015,172M,,,,,,,,,"Ministry of Population, Promotion of Women and Child Protection: Institutional Méchanisms

This NAP follows a previous one, adopted in 2016 for the period 2016-2018. Analysis of the 2020-2024 NAP is forthcoming. The 2016-2018 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Population, Women'ss Empowerment and Child Protection, through a participatory approach that included consultations with civil society organisations, NGOs, and technical and financial partners. The NAP focuses on four priority axes, including: prevention of conflict and gender-based violence; protection, assistance and rehabilitation of victims; participation and representation; coordination, monitoring and evaluation of activities. However, the NAP, while referencing the impact of armed conflict on women, does not offer any specific actions for disarmament and arms control, including monitoring mechanisms for assessing the impact of arms proliferation on sexual and gender-based violence SGBV. While the NAP offers financing specifics as well as a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework, it does not have a timeline. Niger reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Specifically, the report indicates that Niger supported the establishment of the G5 Sahel Women'ss Platform and the development of a three-year action plan for 2019-2021 p. 37. Niger gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule. The country experienced military rule and rebellions, including a military coup in 2010, leading to widespread social and political instability, including lack of access to natural resources; lack of access to public resources, including the redistribution of income from extractive industries; a demographic dividend and marginalisation of women and youth; weak governance, social tensions and the recurrence of political and institutional instability; armed conflicts, including armed rebellions in the northern part of the country. Additionally, socio-political turmoil in Libya, armed conflict in Mali, the presence of Boko Haram and the presence of terrorist groups in the north-west have all led to displacement throughout Niger and an influx of migrants. Most recently, in 2020, Niger received thousands of migrants and asylum seekers, who were expelled by Algeria."
129,Nigeria,13,1,1,28.6,,"Nigeria adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The NAP was developed by the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development with the support of the Nigerian Stability Reconciliation Programme (NSRP), the European Union, and UN Women. The NAP'ss objectives are compiled under five overarching thematic pillars: prevention and disaster preparedness; participation and representation; protection and prosecution; crisis management, early recovery, and post-conflict reconstruction; and partnerships, coordination, and management. The strategic objectives have corresponding actions, outcomes, indicators, target completion timeframes, and lead actors. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. Nigeria'ss most recent NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2013 and implemented for the period 2013-2017. In the course of implementing the first NAP, several gaps were observed and formed the basis, among other reasons, to review the plan in order to incorporate emerging issues in Nigeria (i.e., non-inclusion of violent extremism and limited consideration of post-conflict and reintegration issues), as well as address the gaps identified (i.e., absence of crisis management and recovery strategies, ambiguous language and inadequate monitoring and evaluation architecture). Nigeria reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country indicated that there has been inclusion of women in councils of traditional rulers and periodic gender training for security sector agencies; the social investment budget has been formally introduced into the government budget; and there has been a marginal upsurge in women'ss political participation (p. 14). Nigeria gained independence in 1960 from the United Kingdom, after decades of colonial rule by the British empire. Between 1967 and 1970, Nigeria experienced a civil war, which was preceded by a history of military coups. Most recently, since 2009, the conflict in the country'ss northeast caused by Boko Haram has resulted in an upsurge in violence against women and girls, manifesting itself in the form of systematic abductions. Specifically, following the abductions in 2014, international security meetings on countering Boko Haram were held in London and Paris but failed to include Nigerian women'ss civil society organisations. At the multilateral level, Nigeria most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015.",1985,128,2013,1.860B,"NAP Development
The review process of Nigeria's NAP was inclusive, participatory and included input from civil society organisations and faith-based organisations. A Steering Committee on UNSCR1325 provided guidance for the overall preparation process. The Steering Committee consisted of various government ministries, UN entities and civil society organizations.    
The Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development was the lead agency in the development process of Nigeria's NAP. The NAP Steering Committee, which consisted of government ministries, departments, agencies and civil society organisations, provided guidance for the overall NAP development process.                         
NAP Implementation
Civil society organisations will be present in the process of NAP implementation along with federal ministries, Nigerian Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), National Refugee Commission and development partners, such as UN Women, UNHCR, UNFPA and others.
The Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development is in charge of providing strategic leadership, overall guidance and supervision for the NAP implementation.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The monitoring and evaluation framework which also incorporates a reporting template was developed after careful consultations at zonal and national levels, including with leaders of civil society.
The monitoring and evaluation framework, which also incorporates a reporting template, was developed after careful consultations at zonal and national levels, including with leaders of civil society. This framework is to be used at all levels such as federal, state and community levels. The National Technical Working Group (NTWG) has a critical role in the monitoring and evaluation of the plan. Reports from the local and state levels can be sent to the NAP Secretariat housed in the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs.
WILPF's Contributions to Nigeria's NAP
WILPF Nigeria actively participated in the development process of the second Nigerian NAP. Joy Onyesoh, WILPF Nigeria'ss President, has served as a zonal consultant for the South West of Nigeria providing technical insights and guidance to the process. WILPF Nigeria participated in the validation process of the reviewed NAP.
WILPF Nigeria aims to provide a platform to address conflicts through peaceful and nonviolent means, and to build women'ss capacity as leaders both at the grassroots and national levels. To fulfil its mission, WILPF Nigeria uses the CEDAW and the UNSCR 1325 as a powerful tool to advocate for women'ss rights and for a better representation of women within security issues. The Section organises seminars for women'ss capacity building and for increasing the overall understanding of human rights, while promoting women as agents of change and peace.
WILPF Nigeria is also leading the implementation of the Women'ss Situation Room Nigeria (WSRN) which makes the connection between women'ss essential role in conflict prevention and women'ss active participation in the electoral process, specifically related to observing, monitoring, and reporting on electoral and gender-based violence during the elections.",The implementation period for the Nigerian National Plan of Action is three years (2017-2020).,"The primary objectives of Nigeria's NAP are focused on what Nigeria's NAP refers to as the Five Pillars: Prevention, Participation, Protection, Crisis Management, Partnerships.
Prevention and Disaster Preparedness: To  ensure prevention of conflict and all forms of violence against women and girls, institute coping mechanisms and systems for averting and mitigating disasters;
 Protection and Prosecution: To ensure the rights of women and girls are protected and promoted in conflict and peace and also to prosecute such rights violations;
 Participation and Representation: To increase participation and engagement of women and inclusion of women'ss interests in decision-making processes related to conflict prevention and peacebuilding;
 Crisis Management, Early Recovery and Post-Conflict Reconstruction: To ensure specific relief and recovery needs of women and girls are met and women'ss capacities to act as agents in crisis, recovery and post-conflict situations are reinforced;
 Partnerships, Coordination and Management: To ensure increase in the capacity and resources to coordinate, implement, monitor and report on women, peace and security plans and programmes.","Each area of work has different actions assigned. For example, Pillar 1 (Prevention and Disaster Preparedness) includes the following actions:
Establishment of new laws aimed at protecting women and girls in conflict and disaster;
Implementation of existing and new laws and policies that enhance conflict prevention systems for women;
Training of MDAs (Ministries, Departments and Agencies) and stakeholders on inclusive and gender-responsive approaches to services for conflict and disaster prevention.","Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, the first objective of Pillar 1, ""Establishment of new laws aimed at protecting women and girls in conflict and disaster”, includes several indicators:
Number and types of laws and policies enacted;
Level of compliance to laws and policies safeguarding women from conflict;
Extent to which preventable disasters and violations of human rights of women and girls are reported, referred and investigated;
Number and any types of cases/actions taken/recommendations made to address preventable disasters and violations affecting women and girls.","The monitoring and evaluation framework which also incorporates a reporting template was developed after careful consultations at zonal and national levels, including with leaders of civil society. This framework is to be used at all levels such as federal, state, zonal and community levels.","Pillar 5 of the NAP aims at ensuring increase in resources available to to coordinate, implement, monitor and report on women, peace and security plans and programmes. The NAP will be financed through domestic and external support through a multi-stakeholder approach. Domestic sources include state and non-state actors operating within Nigeria such as the Organized Private Sector, revenue generating state agencies, state governments, and financial Financial Institutions. External sources include UN entities, Regional Economic Community and multi/bi-lateral relations.","Nigeria's NAP does not discuss disarmament issues despite the recent conflicts and use of small arms that have affected women, children, and the civilian population in general.","Legal Aid Council: Services > Health > Protocols and guidelines

131,Norway,4,1,1,,32.1,"Norway adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2023 for the period 2023-2030. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, the Ministry of Culture and Equality, the Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion, and the Ministry of Climate and Environment (p.6).  The NAP also indicates that Norwegian and international civil society organizations, as well as Norwegian research institutes and other relevant experts, provided input and advice throughout the NAP'ss development (p.6). Norway'ss NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and identifies three thematic priorities: peace process and implementation of peace agreements; security policy and operations; and humanitarian efforts, protection of civilians and protection of human rights (p.6). The NAP addresses conflict prevention by committing itself to an intersectional analysis of peace and security (p.6), as well as supporting civil society, women'ss organizations and human rights defenders in conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts (p.13). Notably, under issues relating to the thematic area ‘security policy and operations's, the NAP includes a section on ‘women and climate, peace and security's, where it commits to linking the women, peace and security and climate, peace and security agendas, and dealing with these as interconnected and cross-cutting issues (p.25). Unlike the previous NAP, this one does not include monitoring and evaluation outcomes and indicators. Rather, it outlines different levels of implementation, ministries and actors that are responsible for implementation, and a timeline for reviews (p.36). This includes annual reports on efforts, results and problems related to implementation of the NAP, as well as an interministerial review in 2027 (p.37). The NAP does not include an allocated budget, though indicates that the NAP ""retains the approach of integrating the women, peace and security agenda into the whole breadth of peace and security work rather than creating budget items specifically for this area” (p.36). Norway'ss fifth NAP is preceded by four other NAPS, adopted in 2006, 2011, 2015 and 2019, implemented for the periods 2006-2011; 2011-2015; 2015-2018 and 2019-2022, respectively. In Norway'ss third NAP, priority countries were introduced and then expanded on in the fourth NAP to include Afghanistan, Colombia, Myanmar, Palestine, South Sudan and Nigeria. In the fifth NAP, this list has grown substantially, and Iraq, Jordan, Mali, Mozambique, the Philippines, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen, have all been added as priority countries (p.36). However, the NAP notes that the list will be ""dynamic and can be adjusted as conditions change” (p.36). As a divergence from all previous NAPs, Norway'ss fifth NAP has a section devoted specifically to women and climate, peace and security, where it commits to linking the women, peace and security and climate, peace and security agendas, and dealing with these as interconnected and cross-cutting issues (p.25). Additionally, Norway'ss fifth NAP includes an emphasis on the need for the meaningful participation of women, addressing conflict-related sexual violence, the gendered impact of the climate crisis and gender sensitive responses to emergency planning and response systems. The NAP also states that Norway supports civil society both as a partner and an actor for change, noting the need to: include civil society in peace processes (p.10), bridge the gap between civil society and parties to negotiations (p.13), promote the participation of women human rights defenders and representatives of civil society at the Security Council (p.33), and exchange information and collaborate with civil society to implement the NAP (p.36). Norway'ss NAP also states the importance of integrating a gender perspective into work on arms control and humanitarian disarmament (p.28), though does not expand on how and in what context, nor does it mention Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW). Norway is a major contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund, a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Norway is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2022, Norway was UN Women'ss fourth-largest contributor, with $29.86million . Norway does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but is involved in international peacekeeping and overseas military operations. Standard policy in Norway is that the export of arms to states engaged in war is banned. However, as of January 1 2024, the Norwegian government has permitted direct sales of weapons and defense-related products to Ukraine. Additionally, the Norwegian government owns 64% of weapons manufacturer, Nammo.",1981,2,2014,8.38B,"NAP Development  
The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, the Ministry of Culture and Equality, the Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion, and the Ministry of Climate and Environment (p.6).  The NAP also indicates that Norwegian and international civil society organizations, as well as Norwegian research institutes and other relevant experts, provided input and advice throughout the NAP'ss development (p.6).  
NAP Implementation  
The NAP states that implementation will take place at national, bilateral, regional and multilateral levels, with a variety of actors for each level. It states that regional and multilateral forums will be given priority, which include NATO, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the EU, the Council of Europe, the African Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the UN (p.36), though it does not outline how these organizations contribute to implementation. Similarly, the NAP also adds that cooperation, competence building and exchange of information with civil society organizations and research institutes will be key in implementation, but it does not outline in what capacity. At the national level, multiple ministries are listed as responsible for various goals of the NAP, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Justice and Public Security, Ministry of Culture and Equality, Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion, and the Ministry of Climate and Environment.  
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation  
There is no specific section about monitoring and evaluation of the NAP, unlike the previous NAP, which specified indicators and a results framework. However, the responsible national ministries previously mentioned will, according to the most recent NAP, report annually on their implementation of the NAP.  Civil society is not mentioned in relation to monitoring. 
WILPF 
WILPF Norway is part of an umbrella-organization which organizes women'ss civil society, FOCUS. Part of this organization you will find in the group Forum 1325. This group is in direct connection with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and there has been a continuing communication between the Ministry and the group in working with the NAP. 
WILPF Norway, or Internasjonal Kvinneliga for Fred og Frihet (IKFF), was founded in 1915 when various Norwegian women'ss organizations sent representative delegates to the first WILPF Congress in the Hague. Throughout its history, WILPF Norway has been involved in numerous anti-war protests and has been an important advocate for mediation in international conflicts and the development of peace education and peace studies.  
Today, WILPF Norway continues to be part of initiatives at the national level, in particular against the Norwegian membership of NATO and reclaiming the United Nations as the primary international peace organization. The Section has also been actively campaigning against the inclusion of women in military service and taken a significant role in advocating the banning of nuclear weapons. WILPF Norway also works to raise awareness about UNSCR 1325 and has participated in its wider implementation, pressing the Norwegian Government to further its efforts for peace mediation.","The implementation period for Norway'ss fifth NAP is longer than previous ones - it is seven instead of four years (2023-2030). In the NAP, this longer timeframe is said to give more predictability and encourage a long-term strategic approach to integrated implementation of the WPS agenda (p.36).  ","The 2023-2030 NAP identifies its main objective as being the promotion of sustainable peace and security at the national, regional and global level. It is also stated that an intersectional gender perspective must be integrated into this work, which underlies the three thematic priorities that are identified in the NAP. These include: 
Peace processes and implementation of peace agreements 
Promoting inclusive peace processes and working to encourage more participation of women 
Ensuring a good gender balance in delegations 
Taking a strategic approach to promoting gender issues in negotiations and building bridges between civil society and parties to negotiations 
Contributing to the protection of women peacebuilders and human rights defenders 
Security policy and operations 
Ensuring Norwegian military and civilian personnel have sound knowledge of WPS agenda 
Integrating gender perspective into training, exercises, operations and missions  
Implementing UN and NATO policy and operational guidelines relating to WPS 
Working towards a good gender balance in Armed Forces and police 
Integrating measures to respond to CRSV 
Including women and integrating gender perspective into national efforts to prevent and combat national extremism 
Building and sharing knowledge about links between WPS and climate, peace and security efforts 
Humanitarian efforts, protection of civilians and protection of human rights  
Maintaining efforts to ensure compliance with international law 
Continuing efforts to ensure that a gender perspective is integrated into work on arms control and humanitarian disarmament  
Strengthening research and developing knowledge on how war, conflict and serious crises can affect different groups, and how emergency planning and response system can be made more gender-sensitive  ","Actions and activities are not explicitly mentioned in the NAP, nor are any specific outcomes.  ",There are no specific indicators mentioned in the NAP. Only objectives alongside the ministry responsible for implementation are listed.,"There is no specific section about monitoring and evaluation of the NAP, unlike the previous NAP, which specified indicators and a results framework.

137,Paraguay,6,1,1,,21.9,"Paraguay launched its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015. The NAP was created to establish a framework, strategies, and actions for coordinated implementation of UNSCR 1325. The Action Plan was the result of joint efforts between different national institutions in the framework of a Specific Agreement of Inter-institutional Cooperation signed between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Women, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the Command of the Military Forces of Paraguay. The Action Plan includes four guiding principles: Equal Rights; Gender Equality; Participatory Democracy; and Comprehensiveness. Civil society is only briefly mentioned in the monitoring of the NAP.  The NAP aims at the elimination of cultural barriers that hinder the full participation of women in all aspects related to negotiations and resolution of conflicts, peace and security at the national level. There is no allocated budget or financing plan for objectives set out in the NAP.  The NAP also does not address disarmament issues or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity. Paraguay does not have a recent history of conflict. The National Action Plan has an internal focus, and it aims at eliminating all the cultural barriers that prevent women from participating in all societal spheres. In its national review for Beijing+25 , Paraguay did not report on WPS.",1987,100,2015,403M,"NAP Development
The NAP does not note how civil society will be involved in the development of the NAP.

NAP Monitoring and Evaluation 
The NAP notes that the The Council of Ministries for the Implementation of the UNSCR 1325 (CMI 1325) will monitor implementation of the NAP in coordination with civil society but does not specify how this will be achieved.
The Council of Ministries for the Implementation of the UNSCR 1325, which includes the Ministries mentioned above, will meet annually every 29 May, the International day of United Nations Peacekeepers, to evaluate and held accountable society about the implementation of the NAP by the Interinstitutional Monitoring Committee. The members of this Committee will be appointed by the Ministries, each Ministry will select two. This body, in coordination with civil society, will monitor UNSCR 1325 implementation.","The Paraguayan NAP does not include a dedicated timeframe, but it sets short-term goals for 5 years.","The Action plan includes a long-term goal:
Contribute towards the elimination of cultural barriers that hinder the full participation of women in all aspects related to negotiations and resolution of conflicts, peace and security at the national level.
It also includes four short-term goals (5 years):
Increase women'ss participation in institutional decision-making process regarding peace, prevention and conflict resolution;
Incorporate a gender perspective in all areas related to peace processes and conflict resolution;
Promote peace culture to prevent conflicts, with an active women'ss participation;
Establish an effective coordination at the interinstitutional, intersectional and international level in order to develop joint actions, and to implement and evaluate UNSCR 1325.","Each four short-term goals have different actions assigned.

",3,Latin America & Caribbean,"Paraguay launched its first National Action Plan NAP in 2015. The NAP was created to establish a framework, strategies, and actions for coordinated implementation of UNSCR 1325. The Action Plan was the result of joint efforts between different national institutions in the framework of a Specific Agreement of Inter-institutional Cooperation signed between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Women, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the Command of the Military Forces of Paraguay. The Action Plan includes four guiding principles: Equal Rights; Gender Equality; Participatory Democracy; and Comprehensiveness. Civil society is only briefly mentioned in the monitoring of the NAP. The NAP aims at the elimination of cultural barriers that hinder the full participation of women in all aspects related to negotiations and resolution of conflicts, peace and security at the national level. There is no allocated budget or financing plan for objectives set out in the NAP. The NAP also does not address disarmament issues or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity. Paraguay does not have a recent history of conflict. The National Action Plan has an internal focus, and it aims at eliminating all the cultural barriers that prevent women from participating in all societal spheres. In its national review for Beijing25 , Paraguay did not report on WPS. The Action plan includes a long-term goal: Contribute towards the elimination of cultural barriers that hinder the full participation of women in all aspects related to negotiations and resolution of conflicts, peace and security at the national level. It also includes four short-term goals 5 years: Increase women'ss participation in institutional decision-making process regarding peace, prevention and conflict resolution; Incorporate a gender perspective in all areas related to peace processes and conflict resolution; Promote peace culture to prevent conflicts, with an active women'ss participation; Establish an effective coordination at the interinstitutional, intersectional and international level in order to develop joint actions, and to implement and evaluate UNSCR 1325. Each four short-term goals have different actions assigned. For instance, the first goal, ""Women'ss participation in decision-making progress, include six actions: Diffusion of research opportunities for women in military and police careers. Creation of normative and concrete measures aimed at including and maintaining women in the National Army and National Police bodies. Equal rights mainstreaming in the processes of selection, preparation and send to peace missions until the monitoring and evaluation. Promotion of the incorporation of women in high rank positions in the Army and Police bodies, as well as their participation in decision-making. Promotion of women participation in the Local Emergency Councils Consejos de Emergencia Locales. Creation of a Gender Observatory for the analysis of women and men'ss participation in the Military, Security Forces and peace missions. Regarding the second short-term goal, ""Incorporate a gender perspective in all areas related to peace processes and conflict resolution, there are eight actions established and each action has an indicator. The following are the eight indicators for the eight actions established: A gender perspective and UNSCR 1325 is included in student's handbook of the different educational institutions of police and military. Percentage of material used which consider gender. Atlas de Riesgo Nacional written with a gender perspective. Protocol and manual with a gender perspective. At least one Seminar every two years, national or international. Amount of courses hold a year. Mental Health protocol functioning. Amount of services and human resources participants. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Women, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the Command of the Military Forces of Paraguay are the members of the Council of Ministers for the implementation of 1325, which will meet every May 29 International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers for evaluation and accountability about the Monitoring Interinstitutional Committee implementation process. Every ministry will appoint two representatives to be part of the Committee. The latter will, in cooperation with the civil society, monitor the UNSCR 1325 implementation by holding periodic meetings. The Paraguayan National Action Plan does not include an allocated or estimated budget. No indicators or actions are included that formulate fundraising strategies, detail what level of funding is required for which specific activities, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP. The National Action Plan does not address disarmament issues or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity. Instead, Paraguayan NAP showcases the intention of the Government to re-frame women'ss role in society so that women see themselves as key participants in the country'ss defense sector, rather than addressing intransigent obstacles to women'ss participation and rights."
138,Peru,11,1,1,,23.3,,1982,37,2016,2.361B,"For the development of the National Action Plan, the Ministry of Defense sent seven representatives, the Joint Command of the Armed Forces (CCFFAA) sent two representatives, the National Army also sent two representatives, the Navy sent one, and the Air Forces sent one representative. All in all, the actors involved in the process were part of the National Armed Forces. ",There is no clear timeframe for the implementation of the NAP.,"To promote the empowerment and participation of women in the Armed Forces, motivating a transition from acceptance to inclusion. 
To strengthen military training on gender equality in Peace Operations and other aspects related to UNSCR 1325, in addition to promoting knowledge and dissemination of it. 
To incorporate the principle of equal treatment and opportunities between women and men in planning and specialized training. 
To promote the participation of women in peacekeeping missions in the position of observers, general staff and contingent. 
To raise awareness of the importance of the present and historical contribution of women in national defense. 
To identify the needs to carry out a diagnosis of barriers and regulatory and logistical aspects that allow a more adequate incorporation of women in the defense sector (clothing, footwear, infrastructure, among others).","Participation 
Promote the presence and participation of women in the Peace Operations courses aimed at the deployment of personnel such as Mission Experts, members of the General Staff and Military Contingents.
Deploy female personnel in Peace Operations under the framework of the Strategy established by the United Nations to increase female participation in Peace Operations.
Implement ways to increase female participation in Peacekeeping Operations individually or collectively.
 Relief and Recovery 
Establish agreements to implement compliance with the provisions of the United Nations for the protection of the human rights of women and girls in Peace Operations.
Disseminate in the national, regional and international scenario, the experience and lessons learned on the protection of the human rights of women and girls in Peace Operations.
Support the initiatives of the United Nations in the framework of compliance with UNSCR 1325.
Incorporate personnel who fulfill the function of disseminating information on the ground, as part of the structure of the Contingents deployed in Peacekeeping Operations.
Peru'ss NAP does not present concrete actions or activities for Prevention or Protection and instead they introduce a brief paragraph with an overview of each pillar. However, there is no coherence between the general objectives of the Plan and the following pillars. 

Prevention
This area consists of increasing the number of people who are trained in Women'ss Empowerment and Gender Analysis, as well as increasing the number of hours of training for Peace Operations with a gender perspective, conflict prevention and peace processes. On the other hand, Peru will seek to increase the number of academic articles and academic events on Women, Peace and Security to ensure a wider education on the topic. 

Protection 
This area consists of strengthening and expanding measures to guarantee the security, physical and mental integrity, sexual and reproductive health, well-being, economic autonomy and dignity of women and girls; in respecting and guaranteeing the full exercise of the human rights of women and girls, incorporating the gender perspective in the institutions that play a role in peace, conflict and post-conflict operations.","For each objective and subsequent action the NAP contains a plan with specific indicators. For example, for the first objective of ""incorporating a gender perspective to the responsible entities for the management of peace and security of the Defense Sector”, an indicator is the number of people who are trained in gender and women empowerment. This information can be found pages 13-16. ","For monitoring and evaluation, Peru requires an intersectoral coordination, which contains the Committee for Gender Equality of the Ministry of Defense. This committee integrates other institutions that aim to implement and monitor the proposes, objectives, and activities of the Action Plan. On this topic, the NAP recommends that even though it is limited to the scope of the Ministry of Defense, gender policy should be transversal to other public policies, in which case the Presidency of the Council of Ministers should be able to integrate other sectors in the design, implementation and monitoring of the purposes of UNSCR 1325. For this reason, for the process of monitoring and evaluation, other institutions are to be integrated, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations, the MInistry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice, among others that are not mentioned explicitly.","The NAP does not detail the process of budgeting, however, there is a note on the document which reads: ""Each institution included in the implementation of this NAP must include in its annual budget an item destined to the financing of the activities that correspond to them”.",There are no specific actions related to disarmament in the Peruvian NAP.,"Artculo 2 de la Constitucin Poltica del Per: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

There are no specific actions related to disarmament in the Peruvian NAP."
139,Philippines,6,1,0,82.3,23.4,"The Philippines adopted its most recent National Action plan (NAP) for the period 2023-2033. The 2017-2022 NAP was developed by the NSC WPS Technical Working Group (TWG) through a participatory approach that included consultations with civil society organizations. The NAP'ss overall goal is to ensure the expansion of women'ss role in the various spaces for peace and security. In this regard, it highlights women'ss agency, both as leaders and participants, in the peace process of the country. It seeks to continue the best practice of women'ss presence in formal peace negotiations as well as in other informal spaces (i.e., civil society and grassroots participation). The NAP does not have a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework, but identifies monitoring and evaluation among the NAP'ss standalone pillars and objectives. While the NAP does not have an allocated budget, a subsequent executive order allocated approximately 100,000 USD to fund the first year of implementation. The Philippines's second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010 and implemented for the period 2010-2016. The country'ss second NAP takes off from the findings of the study on the implementation of the 2010-2016 NAP, specifically, building on its gains and addressing the gaps. It adopts a broader framing of addressing the situation of women in armed conflict and recognising their contributions to peacebuilding. The NAP also incorporates some key recommendations made in the 2015 Global Study on UNSCR 1325 such as the prioritisation of conflict prevention; framing women peace and security from a human rights perspective; participation and leadership of women in all levels of the peace project; transitional justice; inclusive and participatory localisation efforts; combating extremism by supporting women peacebuilders; multi-level and multi-stakeholder approach to implementation; and financing initiatives aimed at materialising women, peace and security. The Philippines gained independence from the United States in 1946, having been ruled as a US territory prior to that date. The country has a history of intermittent armed conflicts with various insurgent groups, specifically involving the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the National Democratic Front (NDF). Since 2016, under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, the country has experienced grave human rights violations, specifically through Duterte'ss ""war against drugs,” which has resulted in widespread extrajudicial killings perpetrated by state security forces. Additionally, ongoing rights violations include threats against and direct attacks on human rights defenders, political activists, and environmental and community leaders.

The 2017-2022 NAP was developed by the NSC WPS Technical Working Group TWG through a participatory approach that included consultations with civil society organizations. The NAP'ss overall goal is to ensure the expansion of women'ss role in the various spaces for peace and security. In this regard, it highlights women'ss agency, both as leaders and participants, in the peace process of the country. It seeks to continue the best practice of women'ss presence in formal peace negotiations as well as in other informal spaces i.e., civil society and grassroots participation. The NAP does not have a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework, but identifies monitoring and evaluation among the NAP'ss standalone pillars and objectives. While the NAP does not have an allocated budget, a subsequent executive order allocated approximately 100,000 USD to fund the first year of implementation. The Philippines's second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010 and implemented for the period 2010-2016. The country'ss second NAP takes off from the findings of the study on the implementation of the 2010-2016 NAP, specifically, building on its gains and addressing the gaps. It adopts a broader framing of addressing the situation of women in armed conflict and recognising their contributions to peacebuilding. The NAP also incorporates some key recommendations made in the 2015 Global Study on UNSCR 1325 such as the prioritisation of conflict prevention; framing women peace and security from a human rights perspective; participation and leadership of women in all levels of the peace project; transitional justice; inclusive and participatory localisation efforts; combating extremism by supporting women peacebuilders; multi-level and multi-stakeholder approach to implementation; and financing initiatives aimed at materialising women, peace and security.

Portugal'ss third National Action Plan (NAP) is the result of the evaluation of the previous Action Plan, which provided recommendations for structuring the new NAP. Through this document, the Lisbon government recognizes gender equality and non-discrimination as a constitutional, ethical and legal imperative and seeks to incorporate the gender perspective in the different areas of public policy, particularly in diplomatic, military, security, justice and development cooperation activities; moreover, the NAP defines how Portugal incorporates the UNSCR 1325 on the national, regional and international fronts. The NAP is aligned with Portugal'ss diverse international commitments, including in the European Council, the European Union and the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, and complies with the European Council for the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention). Portugal'ss third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2009 and 2014 and implemented for the period 2009-2013 and 2014-2018, respectively. The first NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda mostly internationally, identifying the goal to ""promot[e] the inclusion of the dimension of gender equality at all stages of peacebuilding processes and the promotion of safety” (p. 5). As such, there is a strong emphasis on women'ss inclusion in peacekeeping missions and peacebuilding efforts among the NAP'ss objectives. The NAP does not have a detailed monitoring and implementation framework, nor does it include an allocated budget. The second NAP was developed through a participatory approach that included a public consultation as well as an independent external evaluation of the country'ss first NAP. Nevertheless, the content of the first NAP'ss objectives remain mostly unchanged in the second NAP, even though the revised action plan has a more detailed implementation matrix. Portugal plays a role in international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. Portugal is a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies.

",4,Western Europe,"Portugal adopted its most recent National Action Plan NAP in 2019 for the period 2019-2022. Portugal'ss third National Action Plan NAP is the result of the evaluation of the previous Action Plan, which provided recommendations for structuring the new NAP. Through this document, the Lisbon government recognizes gender equality and non-discrimination as a constitutional, ethical and legal imperative and seeks to incorporate the gender perspective in the different areas of public policy, particularly in diplomatic, military, security, justice and development cooperation activities; moreover, the NAP defines how Portugal incorporates the UNSCR 1325 on the national, regional and international fronts. The NAP is aligned with Portugal'ss diverse international commitments, including in the European Council, the European Union and the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, and complies with the European Council for the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence Istanbul Convention. Portugal'ss third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2009 and 2014 and implemented for the period 2009-2013 and 2014-2018, respectively. The first NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security WPS agenda mostly internationally, identifying the goal to ""promote the inclusion of the dimension of gender equality at all stages of peacebuilding processes and the promotion of safety p. 5. As such, there is a strong emphasis on women'ss inclusion in peacekeeping missions and peacebuilding efforts among the NAP'ss objectives. The NAP does not have a detailed monitoring and implementation framework, nor does it include an allocated budget. The second NAP was developed through a participatory approach that included a public consultation as well as an independent external evaluation of the country'ss first NAP. Nevertheless, the content of the first NAP'ss objectives remain mostly unchanged in the second NAP, even though the revised action plan has a more detailed implementation matrix. Portugal plays a role in international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. Portugal is a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Portugal was among the top 25 arms exporters in the world. At the multilateral level, Portugal most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2011-2011, and is currently a candidate for a non-permanent member seat for the period 2027-2028. Portugal'ss Action Plan has the following strategic objectives: Strengthen the integration of the Women, Peace and Security agenda, as well as the perspective of equality between women and men, in Portugal'ss interventions on national, regional and international fronts; Protect the human rights of women and girls and punish all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence; Promote the participation of women and youth in conflict prevention and peace building processes; Promote the integration of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in the work of civil society organizations. Based on these, the NAP also establishes specific objectives that structure and shape the Plan. These are: 1.1 Integrate the Women, Peace and Security WPS agenda and the gender equality IMH perspective into policy documents, strategies, operational planning and reporting in the Sectors of defense, foreign policy, development cooperation, security and justice; 1.2 Assure training in defence sectors, including for deployed national forces, foreign policy, development cooperation, security and justice sectors on the WPS and IMH agendas, including the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women, such as, sexual violence; 2.1 Integrate the WPS agenda and the IMH perspective, including violence against women and girls, sexual violence, harmful traditional practices and trafficking of human beings, into legal and judicial cooperation, with the purpose of implementing UNSCR 2106; 2.2 Prevent situations of internal insecurity, such as radicalization and violent extremism, and protect refugees from countries in conflict; 3.1 Foster increased participation of women in decision making; 3.2 Foster initiatives for the participation of the young and youth organizations in promoting a culture of peace, tolerance, intercultural and interreligious dialogue; 3.3 Foster knowledge spreading regarding the WPS agenda and participation of women; 4.1 Reinforce the topics related the WPS agenda in the work of CSOs, namely those acting in conflict, post-conflict, fragile states, in humanitarian crisis situations, or others, and foster their involvement in the implementation of the action plan; 4.2 Promote the WPS agenda and the gender-equality perspective in young people, and in the content of national defense institutions. To analyze the success and impact of the implementation of the NAP, the indicators established in the Portuguese NAP go in line with the Actions. Examples of these include. 1.1.1.5 Number of countries in which Portugal undertakes to support actions promoting the WPS agenda 1.2.1.6 Number of military personnel involved in training actions, per gender, position, course and field of expertise 3.1.3.1 Number of women candidatesTotal number of candidates for participation in international peace support and cooperation missions 3.3.1.6 Studies undertaken regarding the status of women in the security forces 4.1.1.6 Number of projects fostered by the CSOs, within the scope of cooperation, supported, as per type of intervention 4.2.1.1 Number of dissemination actions of UNSCR 1325 2000 among youth carried out The Technical Monitoring Commission is the main actor responsible for the monitoring and evaluation process. Among its responsibilities, the TMC must define the respective result and indicators for each implemented action, monitor the entities responsible for the implementation by means of soliciting data regarding the respective implementation process, annually evaluate the implementation of the measures included in the NAP, reporting to the respective members of the Government. By the end of the timeframe for Portugal'ss third NAP, the TMC must draw up a final report regarding its implementation to be submitted to the respective members of Government during the following year, support a final, external and independent evaluation, and present the proposed revision of the Action Plan up to six months before the end of its term. The Ministerial Counselors for Equality must also support the TMC in the ME process. Portugal'ss NAP stipulates that the assumption of commitments for the execution of the objectives of the document depends on the existence of available funds on part of the relevant public entities. The National Action Plan recognizes the possibility to develop international cooperation programs regarding disarmament, demobilization and reintegration DDR as a part of the strategy to include the WPS agenda in the foreign policy, but does not propose specific actions in this regard."

The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Defense and focuses on implementation of the WPS agenda in the context of defense policy. The NAP does not identify civil society inclusion in the NAP development process. Romania'ss NAP contextualizes the WPS agenda by providing an overview of legislative landmarks pertaining to the advancement of women'ss rights at the domestic level. The NAP focuses heavily on increasing the number of women within the military and its scope focuses on this and related objectives. Furthermore, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. In 2020, Romania adopted a more holistic National Action Plan for the period 2020-2023. Analysis of this plan is forthcoming . Romania transitioned into a democratic regime in 1989, after an extensive period under communist rule. Romania does not have a recent history of armed conflict. However, the country has had a tense relationship with its ethnic Hungarian population, which resulted in violent clashes between Romanians and ethnic Hungarians in the Transylvanian city of Târgu Mureș in 1990. A former member of NATO'ss Partnership for Peace Program , Romania officially joined NATO in 2004. At the multilateral level, Romania most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2004-2005.",1982,55,2015,4.9B,"A number of actors are listed in the beginning of the NAP as being the key actors involved, specifically: the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Romanian Intelligence Service, the Special Telecommunication Service, the Protection and Guard Service, the National Agency for Equal Opportunities between women and men, the National Administration of Penitentiaries, the National University of Political and Administrative Studies, the Civil organization non-profit FRONT, and the Mediation Council.
There is a National Implementation Group which is responsible for implementing the NAP and monitoring its implementation. 
The fourth objective of the NAP is to facilitate cooperation with civil society in the process of implementing the WPS agenda. Under this objective, there are several activities and indicators regarding developing partnerships with NGOs and creating a permanent consultative process with civil society and academia.
The monitoring of the NAP'ss implementation will be done by the National Implementation Group, which includes representatives from the following institutions: Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Romanian Intelligence Service, Special Telecommunication Service, Protection and Guard Service, National Agency for Equal Opportunities between women and men and National Administration of Penitentiaries. The NAP states that this group will also cooperate with other actors including parliamentarians and civil society. The Gender Management Office is the Secretariat of this group.
 ",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2020-2023.,"The National Action Plan grounds itself within the context of the WPS resolutions and the pillars of the agenda, as well as other frameworks in the EU and NATO.

It states that its main goal is to create the ""basis for a series of common policies and directives for the implementation of UNSCR 1325 (2000) used by the institutions of the national defence, public order and national defence system of Romania, as well as other central administration institutions with responsibilities in this field”. 
There are four main objectives of the NAP: Integration of gender perspective in security and defence policies; Increase the representation and significant participation of women in peace negotiations, mediation processes and within peace keeping missions; Prevent and combat all forms of gender based discrimination, harassment and sexual violence; and Cooperation with the civil society in the process of implementing the WPS agenda.

146,Rwanda,23,1,1,61.3,24.3,"Rwanda adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2022. The NAP was developed by a Steering Committee, which was composed of ten ministries, in consultation with civil society members, including women'ss organizations. The NAP is organized under five overarching pillars: participation and leadership of women in decision-making; prevention of violence against women and involvement in conflict prevention; protection from violence; equal access to means of relief, economic recovery and rehabilitation; and women'ss promotion and gender mainstreaming in Rwanda'ss foreign service and international and regional cooperation. Each objective has corresponding actions, indicators, and a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework, but the NAP does not have an allocated budget. Rwanda'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP adopted in 2009 and implemented for the period 2009-2012. Rwanda'ss second NAP builds on an evaluation of and lessons learned from the implementation of the previous NAP, which provided a post-conflict framework to the country for women'ss participation in peace and security processes and the fight against sexual and gender-based violence. The NAP takes a close look at the incremental gains achieved as a result of concerted efforts to implement UNSCR 1325 and the WPS agenda in Rwanda as well as challenges that continue to face the country in addressing women'ss meaningful participation in all facets of life, the occurrence of sexual and gender based violence, and access to resources. Unlike the first Rwandan NAP, where a set of timeframes for specific activities were included in the budget, and was generally one of the most detailed budgets found among NAPs, the second NAP does not provide a budget within the plan. Rwanda reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country reported that women represent 44.3% of community mediators and 48% of the access to Justice Bureaus. It also reported on women'ss involvement in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration processes, including through grassroots cooperatives of women ex-combatants, but indicated that further work is needed to integrate women more fully into peace processes (p. 46). Rwanda gained independence in 1962 from Belgium, after decades of colonial rule. The most recent armed conflict in Rwanda'ss history is the 1994 civil war, which resulted in a genocide where an estimated 800,000-1 million people, mostly the Tutsi minority, were killed by the majority Hutus. The war had a distinct gendered impact on women, as rape was systematically used as a weapon of war. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established in 1994 to prosecute the perpetrators of the genocide, and for the first time in international law, the court recognized sexual violence as a component of genocide. The Rwandan government placed particular emphasis on post-conflict reconstruction in the aftermath of the war, with women playing a key role in recovery efforts. This concerted effort resulted in a constitution that implemented a mandatory 30% quota for women in elected positions. Today, Rwanda is a world leader in women'ss political representation, with women holding over 60% of positions in the lower house. Despite this promising number, structural barriers still exist to women'ss equal rights in daily life.",1981,9,,121M,"NAP Development
Rwandan civil society organisations, including women'ss organisations participated in the creation and the development of the Regional Women's Forum (RWF) which was able to secure space for advocacy and to voice women'ss issues in consultations. Civil society groups who continued to be involved as part of the Steering Committee in the development of the second generation NAP include: Femme/Twese Hamwe, Collectif et Ligue des Associations des Droits de l'sHomme (a umbrella human rights coalition), Pro Femme Twese Hamwe, and the Center for Conflict Management. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Rwanda and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP.
There is a Steering Committee comprised of ten ministries (including Forum of Rwandan Women Parliamentarians, National Women Council, National Unity and Reconciliation Commission, National Human Rights Commission, and Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission among others) tasked with overseeing the implementation of the NAP. 
NAP Implementation
Civil society participated in nationwide consultations with others (government representatives, research institutions, bilateral and multilateral partners) in the development of the NAP. There is also civil society representation in the Steering Committee for the implementation of the NAP. However, the chair of this committee is the head of the Ministry of Gender and Family Protection.
The Rwandan NAP assigns government ministries to specific activities. These include: Ministries of Gender and Family Promotion, and Local Administration, National Women Council, GMO, Rwandan Defense Forces, Forum of Rwandan Parliamentarians, and the ministries listed above and below.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
A Steering Committee is tasked with overseeing the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. The document lists Pro-Femmes Twese Hamwe and CLADHO as the civil society organizations included on the Committee.
A Steering Committee tasked with overseeing the monitoring and evaluation process is comprised of the following ministries: Gender and Family Promotion; Foreign Affairs and East African Community; Local Government; Finance and Economic Planning; Education; Gender and Family Promotion; Health, and the Forum of Rwandan Women Parliamentarians.",The NAP is scheduled for implementation between 2018-2022 through various ministries and local and national levels.,"The current Rwandan NAP is organized into five pillar areas:  
Pillar I: Participation and Leadership of Women in Decision-making
Pillar II: Prevention of Violence against Women and Involvement in Conflict Prevention
Pillar III: Protection From Violence
Pillar IV: Equal Access to Means of Relief, Economic Recovery and Rehabilitation
Pillar V: Women'ss Promotion and Gender Mainstreaming in Rwanda'ss Foreign Service and International and Regional Cooperation
Each pillar has a stated commitment by the government and a set of objectives. For example, for Pillar II: Prevention of Violence against Women and Involvement in Conflict Prevention, the government committs to ""improve intervention strategies in the prevention of violence against women, including engaging more substantially the community and especially men as well as strengthening community institutional capacities to prevent violence”. This is followed by a stated outcome: ""Increased efforts in conflict and SGBV prevention at the local level set of objectives” and supported by a set of projected outputs: Increased public awareness on GBV issues; Improved accountability mechanisms for GBV at the local level; Gender responsive early warning and conflict prevention mechanisms established.",,"An indicator is given for each activity in the NAP. For example, under Pillar II - ""Prevention of Violence against Women and Involvement in Conflict Prevention” - the following indicators are given:
Number of women leaders trained and participating in building peace and security
The number of women in decision making organs is increased
Databank on women with experience in peace and security areas is available
The number of women who have been recruited or appointed to in peace and security positions
Number of women who have been trained in peace and security and the quality of that training
Number of infrastructures adapted to women'ss conditions
A permanent framework of dialogue between grassroots women'ss's leaders for operational
Number of peace and security forums organized
Types of conflict prevention and conflict management partnerships formed
Number training participants and sessions for CNF and training manual","Yearly action plans are to be developed, monitored and reported on in relation to the NAP'ss five pillars. The NAP also indicates a comprehensive M&E framework elaborated by National Technical Working Groups (TWGs) with clear indicators and milestones against which progress will be assessed. Regular monitoring will also enable stakeholders to update, improve and adapt the action plans as contexts change. The Ministry of Gender and Family Protection (MIGEPROF) is responsible for collating reports, and once data is collated, Friends of 1325 Group will meet on a quarterly basis to analyze progress against the set targets. The TWG are to meet once every quarter to discuss progress, challenges and bottlenecks, and suggest timely corrective measures based on RNAP progress reports. The Gender Monitoring Office, which is a member of the national gender machinery, is responsible for monitoring the implementation of international and regional commitments and will oversee review of progress against the stated pillar objectives. The government also plans to produce independent progress reports two years after the adoption of the RNAP and at the end of Plan timeline.","Unlike the previous Rwandan NAP, which covered the period 2009-2012, where a set of timeframes for specific activities were included in the budget, and was generally one of the most detailed budgets in terms of national action plans, this current NAP does not provide a budget (or a mention of it) within the plan.",The Rwandan NAP does not mention disarmament in any of its activities or scope for implementation.,"Law 27/2001 Protection of Children against Violence: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

The 2019-20 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey: Research and statistical data > Violence against women module in survey",2,Sub-Saharan Africa,"Rwanda adopted its most recent National Action Plan NAP in 2018 for the period 2018-2022. The NAP was developed by a Steering Committee, which was composed of ten ministries, in consultation with civil society members, including women'ss organizations. The NAP is organized under five overarching pillars: participation and leadership of women in decision-making; prevention of violence against women and involvement in conflict prevention; protection from violence; equal access to means of relief, economic recovery and rehabilitation; and women'ss promotion and gender mainstreaming in Rwanda'ss foreign service and international and regional cooperation. Each objective has corresponding actions, indicators, and a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework, but the NAP does not have an allocated budget. Rwanda'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP adopted in 2009 and implemented for the period 2009-2012. Rwanda'ss second NAP builds on an evaluation of and lessons learned from the implementation of the previous NAP, which provided a post-conflict framework to the country for women'ss participation in peace and security processes and the fight against sexual and gender-based violence. The NAP takes a close look at the incremental gains achieved as a result of concerted efforts to implement UNSCR 1325 and the WPS agenda in Rwanda as well as challenges that continue to face the country in addressing women'ss meaningful participation in all facets of life, the occurrence of sexual and gender based violence, and access to resources. Unlike the first Rwandan NAP, where a set of timeframes for specific activities were included in the budget, and was generally one of the most detailed budgets found among NAPs, the second NAP does not provide a budget within the plan. Rwanda reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Specifically, the country reported that women represent 44.3 of community mediators and 48 of the access to Justice Bureaus. It also reported on women'ss involvement in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration processes, including through grassroots cooperatives of women ex-combatants, but indicated that further work is needed to integrate women more fully into peace processes p. 46. Rwanda gained independence in 1962 from Belgium, after decades of colonial rule. The most recent armed conflict in Rwanda'ss history is the 1994 civil war, which resulted in a genocide where an estimated 800,000-1 million people, mostly the Tutsi minority, were killed by the majority Hutus. The war had a distinct gendered impact on women, as rape was systematically used as a weapon of war. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ICTR was established in 1994 to prosecute the perpetrators of the genocide, and for the first time in international law, the court recognized sexual violence as a component of genocide. The Rwandan government placed particular emphasis on post-conflict reconstruction in the aftermath of the war, with women playing a key role in recovery efforts. This concerted effort resulted in a constitution that implemented a mandatory 30 quota for women in elected positions. Today, Rwanda is a world leader in women'ss political representation, with women holding over 60 of positions in the lower house. Despite this promising number, structural barriers still exist to women'ss equal rights in daily life. The current Rwandan NAP is organized into five pillar areas: Pillar I: Participation and Leadership of Women in Decision-making Pillar II: Prevention of Violence against Women and Involvement in Conflict Prevention Pillar III: Protection From Violence Pillar IV: Equal Access to Means of Relief, Economic Recovery and Rehabilitation Pillar V: Women'ss Promotion and Gender Mainstreaming in Rwanda'ss Foreign Service and International and Regional Cooperation Each pillar has a stated commitment by the government and a set of objectives. For example, for Pillar II: Prevention of Violence against Women and Involvement in Conflict Prevention, the government committs to ""improve intervention strategies in the prevention of violence against women, including engaging more substantially the community and especially men as well as strengthening community institutional capacities to prevent violence. This is followed by a stated outcome: ""Increased efforts in conflict and SGBV prevention at the local level set of objectives and supported by a set of projected outputs: Increased public awareness on GBV issues; Improved accountability mechanisms for GBV at the local level; Gender responsive early warning and conflict prevention mechanisms established.

151,Senegal,12,1,1,5.8,22.2,"The 2020-2024 NAP reflects the Senegalese government'ss commitment to having a basic tool that harmonizes visions and coordinates the implementation of all actions that converge towards rights and needs of women and girls in peace, security and national reconciliation processes, with a particular emphasis on prevention.  The second-generation NAP aims to establish a diagnosis of the first action plan and to formulate new strategies and actions to be implemented under the new one. The second NAP R1325 aims to ""Implement and ensure coordination and follow-up of UNSC Resolution 1325 and its follow-up at national level”. Its overall objective is to ""Ensure better participation of women and girls of women and girls in the prevention and management of peace and security, as well as a better their specific needs in terms of protection and post-crisis recovery”. Senegal adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2011 for the period 2011-2015. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender through a participatory approach that included several ministries, including the Ministries of Family, Defense, Interior, Justice, Education, and Health, as well as civil society organizations, local groups, and universities. The Steering Committee, composed of government ministries, intergovernmental agencies, and civil society organisations, coordinates and monitors the NAP implementation. The NAP identifies three overarching objectives, based on the pillars of UNSCR 1325: prevention, participation, and relief and recovery. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators, but the monitoring and evaluation framework consists primarily of reports to be submitted to the government every three months. The NAP includes an estimated budget. Senegal gained independence from France in 1960, after a long period of colonial rule under various European empires. The most recent armed conflict in the country'ss history is the Casamance conflict , which has been ongoing since 1982. Women have been key players in the field of peacebuilding, especially through the establishment of the Platform of Women for Peace in Casamance in 2010. At the multilateral level, Senegal most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2016-2017.",1985,99,2014,349M,"The first NAP came to be after the 2010 Regional Forum, which was spearheaded by 11 Ministers of Women, Family and/or Family Affairs, with the participation of the African Union, UN System agencies and a diversity of civil society actors. This Forum had the goal to recommend the States to engage in the creation of their own action plans.  This resulted in the 2011-2015 NAP, elaborated by Senegal in the year following the Forum. 
In May 2015, Senegal carried out an evaluation with the support of UNOWAS, on the implementation of UNSCR 1325 in the country. The recommendations and new directions emphasized the formulation of a new action plan to promote the concrete materialization and consolidation of the Senegalese civil society'ss potential for intervention in the field of peace and security. The second-generation NAP aims to establish a diagnosis of the first action plan and to formulate new strategies and actions to be implemented under the new one. 
The 2020-2024 NAP reflects the Senegalese government'ss commitment to having a basic tool that harmonizes visions and coordinates the implementation of all actions that converge towards rights and needs of women and girls in peace, security and national reconciliation processes, with a particular emphasis on prevention.  
Implementation
The NAP2-R1325 will be implemented according to the Modality ""National Execution”. The Ministry in charge of the implementation is the Ministry of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection, through its Directorate of Equity and Gender Equality. 
The decision-making, orientation and monitoring bodies are made up of (i) the National Monitoring Committee (CNP in French), chaired by the Minister of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection; (ii) the Restricted Committee (CR in French), chaired by the same Ministry; (iii) the Women, Peace and Security Working Group (GT/FPS) coordinated jointly by DEEG and the Steering Committee. The Secretariat of these bodies is provided by DEEG'ss PAN-R1325 Specialized Unit (US/PAN-R1325).
US-NAP-R1325, located within the Gender Equity and Equality Department, is a team made up of a specialist in Gender, Peace and Security, a Monitoring and Evaluation Expert, an Administrative and Financial (RAF), a communications officer and a database manager. This team constitutes the national coordination staff, working independently from the civil servants members of the Steering Committee, which supervises and validates the activities of US/ NAP-R1325.
At local level, activities are carried out through the NAP-R1325 Regional Monitoring Committees (CRS/ NAP-R1325) chaired by regional governors, with secretarial support provided by the structure established by the Governor. The meeting is attended by all decentralized technical services, leaderships of relevant national projects and programs, and all CSOs, particularly women's CSOs active in the field of peace and security, and in promoting the rights and empowerment of women and girls. Following-up to NAP-R1325 will be on the agenda of the Comité Development Committee (CRD) by regional governors.
This system enables the development of a structuring partnership with ongoing collaboration with extension services, NGOs/CSOs, the private sector, projects, as well as the ministerial departments and programmes their intervention programs, with a view to ensuring synergy and greater efficiency and efficiency of interventions.",The implementation period for the Senegalese NAP is 2020-2024.,"The second NAP R1325 aims to ""Implement and ensure coordination and follow-up of UNSC Resolution 1325 and its follow-up at national level"". Its overall objective is to ""Ensure better participation of women and girls of women and girls in the prevention and management of peace and security, as well as a better their specific needs in terms of protection and post-crisis recovery"". It has five main components, each with a specific goal:
 Prevention: establish an integrated national mechanism for early warning and prevention of crises, conflicts and all threats to peace, particularly violent extremism, and to combat the insecurity of women and girls.
Protection: guarantee conditions of safety for women and girls at all times and in situations of crisis or conflict, against all forms of violence, particularly sexual or gender-based violence, by improving the services of the Justice, Police and Army to this end.
Participation and promotion: promote the representation and empowerment of women in the prevention, negotiation and peacekeeping mechanisms and processes of the and in diplomatic missions.
Post-crisis recovery/relief: supporting women and girls affected by crisis situations to help them reintegrate into the workforce, build their resilience and economic empowerment, and rebuilding or improving their living environment.
Coordination of the NAP2-R1325 implementation: Ensure the functionality of the coordination and monitoring-evaluation system for NAP2-R1325 et Suivantes, and ensure optimum human, financial and material resources required for its successful implementation.","For Senegal, there are a number of priority issues/actions that were appointed as the focus of the prevention strategy. These include:
The management of natural resources, due to the impact that they have in the stability of a country. According to the NAP2, plenty of the conflicts in the African continent are due to the control of natural resources, which results in violence and instability.
The easing of political tensions, with the implementation of R1325 providing a framework for harmonizing and expressing the will of the national women'ss civil movement to play its full part in the restructuring of the political field in its various forms and mechanisms. This includes providing the circumstances for women to play their fundamental role as agents of change in new perspectives for the maintenance of peace.","Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, ""the easing of political tensions” includes providing the circumstances for women to play their fundamental role as agents of change in new perspectives for the maintenance of peace.","is to be carried out by the NAP steering team, or any other structure or set up for this purpose, under the supervision of the steering committee and with the ongoing collaboration of the Ministère de la Femme, de la Famille du Genre et de la protection des Enfants. The Steering Committee is responsible for organizing upstream M&E activities with a view to assessing the achievements in line with the standards and procedures defined by the MFFGPE and its partners. This M&E plan should thus contribute to defining methodological and technical procedures to assess and measure the successful implementation of this action plan.
In order to report on the results of the actions carried out, the PAN-R1325 Steering Committee is responsible for validation of reports prepared by the Coordination Unit:
 Start-up report: Responsible - MFFGPE/DEEG, NAP2 Steering Committee; Frequency: one-time

Action plan final report: MFFGPE/DEEG, NAP2 Steering Committee; Frequency: last semester of the NAP2 execution. ","The Action Plan includes a detailed budget with a breakdown of the cost of the implementation. The overall cost of implementing component 1 (setting up an integrated early warning and conflict prevention, also focusing on the fight against the insecurity of women and girls) NAP is US$ 952 406,45. Meanwhile, the cost of the implementation of component 2 (promoting the representation and empowerment of women in prevention, negotiation and peacekeeping processes) is US$ 869 147,68. The cost of the implementation of component 3 (ensuring conditions for women and girls at all times and in situations of crisis against all forms of sexual or gender-based violence, by improving justice, police and military services to this end) is US$ 1 581 604,44. The cost of the implementation of component 4 (supporting women and girls who are victims of crisis and conflict situations for their professional reintegration and economic autonomy, and the rebuilding or improving of their living environment) is US$ 1 093 430,00. The cost of the implementation of component 5 (structure the coordination, monitoring and evaluation system for PAN2-R1325 and following, ensuring optimal mobilization of human, financial and material resources required for implementation and better by stakeholders and targets) is US$ 1 331 274,51.

Health Sector Codes of Conduct to Combat GBV / Conduct Codes of the Sant sector to fight against VBG: Services",2,Sub-Saharan Africa,"The 2020-2024 NAP reflects the Senegalese government'ss commitment to having a basic tool that harmonizes visions and coordinates the implementation of all actions that converge towards rights and needs of women and girls in peace, security and national reconciliation processes, with a particular emphasis on prevention. The second-generation NAP aims to establish a diagnosis of the first action plan and to formulate new strategies and actions to be implemented under the new one. The second NAP R1325 aims to ""Implement and ensure coordination and follow-up of UNSC Resolution 1325 and its follow-up at national level. Its overall objective is to ""Ensure better participation of women and girls of women and girls in the prevention and management of peace and security, as well as a better their specific needs in terms of protection and post-crisis recovery. Senegal adopted its first National Action Plan NAP in 2011 for the period 2011-2015. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender through a participatory approach that included several ministries, including the Ministries of Family, Defense, Interior, Justice, Education, and Health, as well as civil society organizations, local groups, and universities. The Steering Committee, composed of government ministries, intergovernmental agencies, and civil society organisations, coordinates and monitors the NAP implementation. The NAP identifies three overarching objectives, based on the pillars of UNSCR 1325: prevention, participation, and relief and recovery. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators, but the monitoring and evaluation framework consists primarily of reports to be submitted to the government every three months. The NAP includes an estimated budget. Senegal gained independence from France in 1960, after a long period of colonial rule under various European empires. The most recent armed conflict in the country'ss history is the Casamance conflict , which has been ongoing since 1982. Women have been key players in the field of peacebuilding, especially through the establishment of the Platform of Women for Peace in Casamance in 2010. At the multilateral level, Senegal most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2016-2017. The second NAP R1325 aims to ""Implement and ensure coordination and follow-up of UNSC Resolution 1325 and its follow-up at national level"". Its overall objective is to ""Ensure better participation of women and girls of women and girls in the prevention and management of peace and security, as well as a better their specific needs in terms of protection and post-crisis recovery"". It has five main components, each with a specific goal: Prevention: establish an integrated national mechanism for early warning and prevention of crises, conflicts and all threats to peace, particularly violent extremism, and to combat the insecurity of women and girls. Protection: guarantee conditions of safety for women and girls at all times and in situations of crisis or conflict, against all forms of violence, particularly sexual or gender-based violence, by improving the services of the Justice, Police and Army to this end. Participation and promotion: promote the representation and empowerment of women in the prevention, negotiation and peacekeeping mechanisms and processes of the and in diplomatic missions. Post-crisis recoveryrelief: supporting women and girls affected by crisis situations to help them reintegrate into the workforce, build their resilience and economic empowerment, and rebuilding or improving their living environment. Coordination of the NAP2-R1325 implementation: Ensure the functionality of the coordination and monitoring-evaluation system for NAP2-R1325 et Suivantes, and ensure optimum human, financial and material resources required for its successful implementation. For Senegal, there are a number of priority issuesactions that were appointed as the focus of the prevention strategy. These include: The management of natural resources, due to the impact that they have in the stability of a country. According to the NAP2, plenty of the conflicts in the African continent are due to the control of natural resources, which results in violence and instability. The easing of political tensions, with the implementation of R1325 providing a framework for harmonizing and expressing the will of the national women'ss civil movement to play its full part in the restructuring of the political field in its various forms and mechanisms. This includes providing the circumstances for women to play their fundamental role as agents of change in new perspectives for the maintenance of peace. Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, ""the easing of political tensions includes providing the circumstances for women to play their fundamental role as agents of change in new perspectives for the maintenance of peace. is to be carried out by the NAP steering team, or any other structure or set up for this purpose, under the supervision of the steering committee and with the ongoing collaboration of the Ministère de la Femme, de la Famille du Genre et de la protection des Enfants. The Steering Committee is responsible for organizing upstream ME activities with a view to assessing the achievements in line with the standards and procedures defined by the MFFGPE and its partners. This ME plan should thus contribute to defining methodological and technical procedures to assess and measure the successful implementation of this action plan. In order to report on the results of the actions carried out, the PAN-R1325 Steering Committee is responsible for validation of reports prepared by the Coordination Unit: Start-up report: Responsible - MFFGPEDEEG, NAP2 Steering Committee; Frequency: one-time Annual activities reports: Responsible - USDEEG; Frequency: trimestral Periodic reports: Responsible - MFFGPEDEEG, NAP2 Steering Committee; Frequency: annual Mid-term evaluation: MFFGPEDEEG, Independent Cabinet of the Steering Committee; Frequency: one-time 1st semester of the 3rd year Final evaluation: Responsible - MFFGPE, USDEEG Independent Cabinet of the Steering Committee; Frequency: last trimester of the NAP execution NAP2 publications Action plan final report: MFFGPEDEEG, NAP2 Steering Committee; Frequency: last semester of the NAP2 execution. The Action Plan includes a detailed budget with a breakdown of the cost of the implementation. The overall cost of implementing component 1 setting up an integrated early warning and conflict prevention, also focusing on the fight against the insecurity of women and girls NAP is US 952 406,45. Meanwhile, the cost of the implementation of component 2 promoting the representation and empowerment of women in prevention, negotiation and peacekeeping processes is US 869 147,68. The cost of the implementation of component 3 ensuring conditions for women and girls at all times and in situations of crisis against all forms of sexual or gender-based violence, by improving justice, police and military services to this end is US 1 581 604,44. The cost of the implementation of component 4 supporting women and girls who are victims of crisis and conflict situations for their professional reintegration and economic autonomy, and the rebuilding or improving of their living environment is US 1 093 430,00. The cost of the implementation of component 5 structure the coordination, monitoring and evaluation system for PAN2-R1325 and following, ensuring optimal mobilization of human, financial and material resources required for implementation and better by stakeholders and targets is US 1 331 274,51. The overall budget is US 5 827 863,08. Senegal'ss NAP does not discuss disarmament issues."
152,Serbia,4,1,1,96.2,,"Serbia adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The NAP was developed through a collaborative process that included representatives of public administration and local self-government bodies, academia, civil society organisations, and independent experts. The NAP takes into account the results of the evaluations of the implementation of the previous NAP, undertaken by civil society organisations. The NAP identifies five overarching objectives, including developing preventive mechanisms to protect women before, during, and after conflict as well as increasing women'ss representation in all decision-making processes pertaining to peace and security. The NAP identifies corresponding actions and indicators as well as an allocated budget for each action identified. Serbia'ss most recent NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010 and implemented for the period 2010-2015. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Defense. The NAP has seven key pillars focused on institutions; representation; decision-making; inclusion; protection; education; and media. In particular, the NAP focuses on increasing women'ss representation in decision-making positions and processes within the defense and security sector; conflict resolution and post-conflict context; and in multinational operations. The NAP also emphasizes protecting women and girls from humans rights violations and gender-based violence. While the second NAP includes fewer pillars, focusing on actors, institutional bodies, and mechanisms; prevention; participation; protection; and recovery, the content of the overall objectives remains similar. Additionally, Serbia'ss second NAP includes a dedicated section to review the challenges of implementing the first NAP, which include, among others, a general lack of awareness among local governments about Resolution 1325 and Serbia'ss NAP. Additionally, the survey revealed that there were no women mayors among those surveyed, and no funds were allocated to the implementation of designated activities to implement the actions identified in the NAP. This survey was complemented by a civil society report, and led to public consultations for the drafting of the revised action plan. Serbia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following update, among others: The Women, Peace and Security area is integrated into the National Gender Equality Strategy for the period from 2016 to 2020, which particularly emphasizes the importance of the active role of women in preserving peace and security, points to the consequences of armed conflict on women and girls and the importance of the active role of women in peacebuilding and the country'ss post-conflict recovery. The area of Women, Peace and Security, i.e. the application of CEDAW'ss General Recommendation No 30 is part of Serbia'ss reporting to the CEDAW Committee. Moreover, the European Charter for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life signed by 73 municipalities, recognizes the need to develop local policies with the aim of improving security of women and men, especially safety and security in the local community and combating gender- based violence. (p. 66) Serbia became an independent state in 2006 after its peaceful separation from Montenegro, both of whom were previously part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The most recent history of armed conflict in Serbia'ss history is the Yugoslav Wars (1991-1999), in which Serbia was involved through its military interventions in the wars in Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Kosovo. Serbian forces perpetrated numerous war crimes as part of these conflicts, including ethnic cleansing, genocide, and systematic rape. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established in 1993 to prosecute crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars. In 2019, Serbia was among the top 5 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 43% increase in its military spending.",2001,39,2014,1.1B,"NAP Development
The development of Serbia'ss NAP was inclusive, participatory and included input from civil society organisations (CSOs). The development of the new National Action Plan takes into account the results of the evaluations of the implementation of the previous National Action Plan (2010-2015), implemented by civil society organisations. It took into account the research studies of the academic community, civil society and international organisations concerning the implementation of UNSC Resolution 1325. In addition, public consultations on the Draft National Action Plan were organised by the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Office for Cooperation with Civil Society, the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities of Serbia and the OSCE Mission to Serbia in May and June 2016 in six cities.
WILPF does not have a country section in Serbia and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP. 
The NAP drafting efforts were coordinated by the Belgrade Fund for Political Excellence, the Government of the Republic of Serbia, at the proposal of the Ministry of Defence.
NAP Implementation
The NAP highlights the role of civil society as the NAP implementing partner.  For instance, under Action 1.8 ""Engaging and building the capacity of civil society organisations, academia and other actors involved in the implementation of the NAP”, the indicators are:
Number of projects and programmes for the implementation of the NAP;
The existence of a public competition for monitoring the implementation of the NAP;
Number of considered, accepted and refused civil society initiatives related to the implementation of the NAP.
The NAP assigns multiple bodies to implement the plan including the Political Council of the Government, Operational Body of the Government, and the Advisor for the implementation of the National Action Plan.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society is one of the entities responsible for the monitoring of the Plan. The NAP states that independent monitoring should continue to be performed by representatives of citizen associations (civil society organisations), academic community and the media, within their scopes of work. The NAP highlights the importance of ensuring the participation of relevant bodies dealing with gender equality at the provincial and local level.
The NAP assigns multiple bodies to monitor the implementation of the Plan, including the Commission for Monitoring the Implementation of the National Action Plan and the analytical groups and research teams.",The NAP implementation period is three years (2017-2020).,"The primary objectives of Serbia's NAP include: 
Improved efficiency and effectiveness of work of all actors, institutional bodies and mechanisms envisaged for the implementation of the National Action Plan;
Developed preventive mechanisms to increase the security of women in peace, conflict and post-conflict rehabilitation of society in the country and abroad;
Increased representation, inclusion and decision-making of women in all the processes related to the preservation of peace and security;
Improved regulatory conditions and institutional capacities for accessible and effective protection of women;
Enhanced system of support for the recovery of women who have suffered any form of threat to security in the post-conflict rehabilitation of society, crisis and emergency situations.",,"Each strategic objective has a number of listed outputs. For example, the first policy objective of Strategic Objective 1, "". Establishment and regular functioning of the Political Council for the implementation of the National Action Plan for the implementation of the UNSC Resolution 1325 – Women, Peace and Security in the Republic of Serbia in the period 2017-2020 (NAP)”, includes several indicators: -Adopted Government'ss Conclusion on establishing the Political Council; -Considered reports and evaluations of the implementation of the NAP, submitted by the Operational Body; -Number and content of the meetings held by the Political Council; -Number of reports submitted to the Government along with the proposal of further activities related to the implementation of UNSC Resolution 1325 in the Republic of Serbia; -Adopted Rules of Procedure and Activity Plan; -Number of recommendations/ decisions; -Participation in relevant national and international conferences; -Number of regular reports submitted to the Government.

154,Sierra Leone,20,1,1,27.8,23.1,"Sierra Leone adopted its second National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2019-2023.  Its first National Action Plan (NAP) adopted in 2010 for the period 2010-2014 was developed by a collaborative process that was undertaken by a Government-Civil Society Task Force. Sierra Leone reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country stated that the implementation of the first NAP was affected by the outbreak of Ebola, and it expired in 2014 without achieving many of its strategic objectives. In November 2015, UN Women hired a consultant to undertake the final evaluation of the Sierra Leone National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 and 1820 (2010-2014). Consultations were carried out throughout the country in collaboration with the National Steering Committee members, a structure formed for the implementation of the NAP, and offered recommendations for the second NAP. The NAP in 2019, SiLNAP II, built upon this final evaluation, as well as in-country monitoring and evaluation reports.  It aligns with the national priorities contained in The National Gender Strategic Plan, the Draft Gender Equality and Women'ss Empowerment Policy, and the Sierra Leone'ss Medium-Term National Development Plan.  SiLNAP II focuses on six pillars of action: prevention of conflict in communities and addressing the root causes of conflicts at all levels; protection and support of women, girls and SGBV survivors and other vulnerable persons; prosecute and punish perpetrators of SGBV effectively and safeguard women'ss, adolescent'ss and girls's rights at all times as well as rehabilitate perpetrators; participation and representation of women in leadership at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding and development processes; promote peace culture and empower communities to generate and sustain their own well-being, environmental security and early response to health emergencies; promote effective coordination implementation monitoring and evaluation and reporting of the National Action Plan.  It has a comprehensive and detailed framework for monitoring and evaluation, as well as a concrete budget. Sierra Leone gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1961, after decades of colonial rule under the British empire. The country was subsequently ruled under a military dictatorship from 1967 to 1968. The most recent history of armed conflict in Sierra Leone is the civil war, which lasted from 1991 until 2002. The war had a disproportionate impact on women and girls, with thousands of women subjected to sexual violence as a weapon of war. In 2004, the Special Court for Sierra Leone ruled that the systematic violence that women were subjected to as ""bush wives” during the war constituted a new crime against humanity in the form of forced marriage.  Similarly, sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) increased alarmingly in the Ebola outbreak of 2014, including an uptick of girls impregnated by a male household member or security agents enforcing quarantine.  On the 7th February 2019 Julius Maada Bio, the President of Sierra Leone, made an official declaration of a National Emergency on Rape and Sexual Violence, as a prevention and response mechanism. Despite the grave human rights violations they experienced and the fact they were at the forefront of peace, security and reconciliation efforts, women were excluded from the Lomé Peace Agreement signed in 1999, and thus were not among the negotiators, mediators, or signatories. The agreement included one provision on women'ss role in post-conflict reconstruction, which stated that ""special attention shall be accorded to [women'ss] needs and potentials in formulating and implementing national rehabilitation, reconstruction and development programmes, to enable them to play a central role in the moral, social and physical reconstruction of Sierra Leone.”",1988,111,2014,25.6M,"NAP Development
Sierra Leone'ss NAP development was initiated by The Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children'ss Affairs, with National Steering Committee on the implementation of UNSCRs 1325 & 1820 (NSC), in close consultation with a variety of stakeholders and actors working with WPS, such as gender focal point officers, Monitoring and Evaluation officers, Paramount Chiefs and other Community/Chiefdom level traditional authorities, UN agencies including UN Women and UNESCO, and civil society organizations.
NAP Implementation
The Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children Affairs (MSWGCA) will mainly coordinate the implementation.  However, it will be inclusively implemented through the application of a localisation strategy, with the strong collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Local Government  and Rural Development, MSWGCA and local councils.  This is a ‘is a people-based approach premised on the rationale that local ownership and participation enables more effective policy action taking's (p. 12).
NAP monitoring and evaluation
The NAP stipulates a long list of institutions that will be involved in the monitoring and evaluation process, with responsibilities such as the production of data and reporting on the implementation.  They include various governmental departments like MSWGCA, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence; Local Government and Councils; Family Support Units (FSUs)/Special Unit on Sexual Penetration of Minors and the Sierra Leone Police 69 (SLP); The Human Rights Commission in Sierra Leone (HRCSL); National Committee on Gender-Based Violence (NAC-GBV); Traditional Authorities, Chiefdom Councils, and the Communities. 
Civil society is included through non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society organizations (CSOs), women'ss organizations, and community-based organizations (CBOs).",The implementation period for Sierra Leone'ss NAP is five years (2019-2023).,"The NAP is organized into six overarching pillars, based on the priorities identified in consultations:
Prevention of conflict in communities and addressing the root causes of conflicts at all levels;
Protection and support of women, girls and SGBV survivors and other vulnerable persons;
Prosecute and punish perpetrators of SGBV effectively and safeguard women'ss, adolescent'ss and girls's rights at all times as well as rehabilitate perpetrators;
Participation and representation of women in leadership at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding and development processes;
Promote peace culture and empower communities to generate and sustain their own well-being, environmental security and early response to health emergencies;
Promote effective coordination, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting of the National Action Plan.","The NAP is comprehensive in its approach to the specified overarching goals.  It breaks each of the six pillars into output objectives, each with a set of strategies and specific activities.
For example, under Pillar 1 of ‘Prevention of conflict in communities and addressing the root causes of conflicts at all levels's, the first output objective is ‘Communities's stakeholders's commitment to promoting peaceful coexistence by addressing the root causes of conflict at community level increased/strengthened's (p. 22), with two strategies:  
Ensuring the establishment and approval and implementation of bylaws that seek to prevent VAW/GBV and protect women, girls and adolescent youth, and vulnerable persons
Parliamentary Finance Oversight Committee examination and assessing existing national budget allocation to GE and specifically to SiLNAP implementation
Specific activity for these strategies: ‘Harmonise/ align the relevant provisions of and remove inconsistency between the Child Rights Act and the Registration of Customary Marriage and Divorce Act with respect to age of marriage's (p. 22).
 ","Each output objective within the six pillars is given a set of indicators (with an emphasis on quantitative indicators throughout the NAP), as well as primary stakeholders, other partners and timeline for completion.
For example, under Pillar 4 of ‘Participation and representation of women in leadership at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding and development processes's, the output objective ‘Representation of women in Security committees at provincial, district and chiefdom levels and other governance committees at especially chiefdom levels's (p. 33) is given 3 indicators: 
Number of meetings held with officials in the security sector 
Percentage of women made aware of their roles and responsibilities in peacebuilding 
100 women trained in peacebuilding and human rights in districts and chiefdoms
The list of stakeholders for this goal is naturally long, given the aim of participation throughout all levels, and includes ONS, Regional, District, and local council officials, Chiefdom Council officials, community women, traditional authorities, the parliamentary Female Caucus, the Legislative committee, ‘Male Champions's, and women'ss organizations.  Other partners identified are bilateral and multilateral organizations, as well as the United Nations Development Programme.  The timeline indicated for this particular output objective is 2019-2022.","The NAP includes a robust framework for implementation.  There are four objectives for the framework (p. 54)
Determining the institutional readiness at all levels (national and local level) for the monitoring and evaluation of the National Action Plan (NAP) for the implementation of UNSCRs 1325 and 1820. 
Defining an institutional framework with clear roles and responsibilities for all relevant actors. 
Identifying monitorable indicators and developing a results framework that will guide the tracking of progress in the implementation of the NAP. 
Setting up data collection guidelines for measuring progress in the implementation of the NAP.
The framework is based on the same objective outputs, and summarized strategies with an output, indicator, MoV, baseline data, four milestones and a target per strategy.
For instance, Pillar 3 of ‘Prosecute and punish perpetrators of SGBV effectively and safeguard women'ss, adolescent'ss and girls's rights at all times as well as rehabilitate perpetrators's includes the objective output of ‘Institutions and other justice sector mechanisms committed to protect women, adolescents and girls from, and respond to VAW and sexual violence offences's.  For the strategy ‘Enhance the effectiveness of gender justice institutions's (p.56): 
Output: Capacitated gender justice institutions
Indicator: Number of gender related issues speedily investigated, prosecuted and verdict passed 
MoV: FSU, Courts and related NGOs, e.g., Rainbow Centre records 
Baseline data: To be determined 
Milestones: Gaps in gender justice sector institutions identified; Capacitated gender justice sector institutions; Period for investigation, prosecution and verdict passed on gender related issues reduced by 20%; Period for investigating, prosecuting and passing verdict on gender issues reduced by 20%
Target: Period for gender related trials reduced by 40%","Each specific action within the six pillars is given a budget estimate in USD($) for each year of implementation, as well as a total budget for all years.
For example, under Pillar 2, the fourth output objective of reducing teenage pregnancy in local communities, is broken down into five specific activities including: 
Action 1 of ‘Hold dialogue sessions with key communities's stakeholders, including traditional leaders, male champions, parents, especially fathers and teenagers's (p. 38) is allocated $50,000 USD per year for 2019 and 2020, and $40 000 USD per year for 2021, 2022 and 2023.  The total budget for Action 1 is $220,000 USD.
Action 3 of ‘Provide livelihood skills training in agriculture, and other sectors's (p. 39) is allocated $80 000 USD per year for 2019, 2020 and 2021, and $60 000 USD per year for 2022 and 2023.  The total budget is $360,000 USD.
In addition, the NAP includes a section on resource mobilization.  A list of potential sources of donations across multilateral and bilateral organizations, the private sector, NGOs/CSOs/CBOs, and other sources can be found on p. 46.  A budget for the implementation of the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan is also included (p. 68).  It is broken down into three sections of capacity building ($115,000 USD over 5 years), running institutional framework ($135,000 USD over 5 years) and support to routine data systems ($150,000 USD over 5 years).","The NAP does not include provisions for disarmament nor does it address small arms or weapons.  Despite a focus on SGBV in two of the six pillars and the country'ss post-conflict context, the NAP does not address small arms and light weapons (SALW), control measures of SALW, nor the gendered impacts of their illegal circulation, particularly in increasing the risk of SGBV.","National Taskforce on Human Trafficking: Institutional mechanisms

Its first National Action Plan NAP adopted in 2010 for the period 2010-2014 was developed by a collaborative process that was undertaken by a Government-Civil Society Task Force. Sierra Leone reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Specifically, the country stated that the implementation of the first NAP was affected by the outbreak of Ebola, and it expired in 2014 without achieving many of its strategic objectives. In November 2015, UN Women hired a consultant to undertake the final evaluation of the Sierra Leone National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 and 1820 2010-2014. Consultations were carried out throughout the country in collaboration with the National Steering Committee members, a structure formed for the implementation of the NAP, and offered recommendations for the second NAP. The NAP in 2019, SiLNAP II, built upon this final evaluation, as well as in-country monitoring and evaluation reports. It aligns with the national priorities contained in The National Gender Strategic Plan, the Draft Gender Equality and Women'ss Empowerment Policy, and the Sierra Leone'ss Medium-Term National Development Plan. SiLNAP II focuses on six pillars of action: prevention of conflict in communities and addressing the root causes of conflicts at all levels; protection and support of women, girls and SGBV survivors and other vulnerable persons; prosecute and punish perpetrators of SGBV effectively and safeguard women'ss, adolescent'ss and girls's rights at all times as well as rehabilitate perpetrators; participation and representation of women in leadership at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding and development processes; promote peace culture and empower communities to generate and sustain their own well-being, environmental security and early response to health emergencies; promote effective coordination implementation monitoring and evaluation and reporting of the National Action Plan. It has a comprehensive and detailed framework for monitoring and evaluation, as well as a concrete budget. Sierra Leone gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1961, after decades of colonial rule under the British empire. The country was subsequently ruled under a military dictatorship from 1967 to 1968. The most recent history of armed conflict in Sierra Leone is the civil war, which lasted from 1991 until 2002. The war had a disproportionate impact on women and girls, with thousands of women subjected to sexual violence as a weapon of war. In 2004, the Special Court for Sierra Leone ruled that the systematic violence that women were subjected to as ""bush wives during the war constituted a new crime against humanity in the form of forced marriage. Similarly, sexual and gender-based violence SGBV increased alarmingly in the Ebola outbreak of 2014, including an uptick of girls impregnated by a male household member or security agents enforcing quarantine. On the 7th February 2019 Julius Maada Bio, the President of Sierra Leone, made an official declaration of a National Emergency on Rape and Sexual Violence, as a prevention and response mechanism. Despite the grave human rights violations they experienced and the fact they were at the forefront of peace, security and reconciliation efforts, women were excluded from the Lomé Peace Agreement signed in 1999, and thus were not among the negotiators, mediators, or signatories. The agreement included one provision on women'ss role in post-conflict reconstruction, which stated that ""special attention shall be accorded to women'ss needs and potentials in formulating and implementing national rehabilitation, reconstruction and development programmes, to enable them to play a central role in the moral, social and physical reconstruction of Sierra Leone. The NAP is organized into six overarching pillars, based on the priorities identified in consultations: Prevention of conflict in communities and addressing the root causes of conflicts at all levels; Protection and support of women, girls and SGBV survivors and other vulnerable persons; Prosecute and punish perpetrators of SGBV effectively and safeguard women'ss, adolescent'ss and girls's rights at all times as well as rehabilitate perpetrators; Participation and representation of women in leadership at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding and development processes; Promote peace culture and empower communities to generate and sustain their own well-being, environmental security and early response to health emergencies; Promote effective coordination, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting of the National Action Plan. The NAP is comprehensive in its approach to the specified overarching goals. It breaks each of the six pillars into output objectives, each with a set of strategies and specific activities. For example, under Pillar 1 of Prevention of conflict in communities and addressing the root causes of conflicts at all levels's, the first output objective is Communities's stakeholders's commitment to promoting peaceful coexistence by addressing the root causes of conflict at community level increasedstrengthened's p. 22, with two strategies: Ensuring the establishment and approval and implementation of bylaws that seek to prevent VAWGBV and protect women, girls and adolescent youth, and vulnerable persons Parliamentary Finance Oversight Committee examination and assessing existing national budget allocation to GE and specifically to SiLNAP implementation Specific activity for these strategies: Harmonise align the relevant provisions of and remove inconsistency between the Child Rights Act and the Registration of Customary Marriage and Divorce Act with respect to age of marriage's p. 22. Each output objective within the six pillars is given a set of indicators with an emphasis on quantitative indicators throughout the NAP, as well as primary stakeholders, other partners and timeline for completion. For example, under Pillar 4 of Participation and representation of women in leadership at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding and development processes's, the output objective Representation of women in Security committees at provincial, district and chiefdom levels and other governance committees at especially chiefdom levels's p. 33 is given 3 indicators: Number of meetings held with officials in the security sector Percentage of women made aware of their roles and responsibilities in peacebuilding 100 women trained in peacebuilding and human rights in districts and chiefdoms The list of stakeholders for this goal is naturally long, given the aim of participation throughout all levels, and includes ONS, Regional, District, and local council officials, Chiefdom Council officials, community women, traditional authorities, the parliamentary Female Caucus, the Legislative committee, Male Champions's, and women'ss organizations. Other partners identified are bilateral and multilateral organizations, as well as the United Nations Development Programme. The timeline indicated for this particular output objective is 2019-2022. The NAP includes a robust framework for implementation. There are four objectives for the framework p. 54 Determining the institutional readiness at all levels national and local level for the monitoring and evaluation of the National Action Plan NAP for the implementation of UNSCRs 1325 and 1820.

157,Slovenia,3,1,1,,34,"Slovenia adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2020. The NAP was developed by the country'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the findings of the implementation review of the first NAP. The NAP is grounded in various national and international frameworks that pertain to gender mainstreaming in peace and security. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda both domestically and internationally, while indicating that Slovenia'ss capacity to integrate a gender perspective to peace and security in the international arena will bolster the country'ss implementation of the WPS Agenda at the national level. The NAP also stresses the importance of a domestic focus to the action plan in order to address emergent issues of the increasing number of migrants and violent extremism. The NAP identifies five overarching goals: integration of gender in peace and security policy; women'ss increased involvement in the peace and security sector arena; protection of women and girls from and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV); education and training pertaining to WPS; and prosecution of perpetrators of SGBV. While the NAP has a monitoring and implementation framework, it does not include an allocated budget. Slovenia'ss second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010 and implemented for the period 2010-2015. The NAP identifies gender mainstreaming in conflict prevention and resolution, including through strengthening women'ss role in preventing conflict and post-conflict reconstruction; increasing the number of women in peacekeeping missions; and protection of women and girls from and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence in conflict and post-conflict settings. While similar in areas of focus, the second NAP expands these objectives. Whereas the first NAP does not focus on disarmament, for instance, the second NAP mentions promoting gender mainstreaming in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts. Additionally, the second NAP provides an overview of accomplishments in implementing the first NAP, both domestically and internationally, including through quantifiable measures. Nevertheless, the NAP does not specifically identify lessons learned in terms of challenges encountered during the first NAP'ss implementation. Furthermore, while financing WPS actions is addressed within the second NAP, neither action plan has an allocated budget. Slovenia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 after a brief conflict (also referred to as the ""Ten-Day War”) between Yugoslav and Slovenian forces. The country has not had a history of conflict since then. Slovenia is a contributor to overseas military missions and peacekeeping operations. Additionally, a previous member of NATO'ss Partnership for Peace Program , Slovenia became a full member of NATO in 2004. At the national level, in 2015, Slovenia'ss Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities adopted a set of Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming in the Work of Ministries. In 2016, Slovenia established the Advocate of the Principle of Equality, which is an independent body charged with gender equality.",1992,36,2014,569M,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that ""civil society and other stakeholders” were consulted about the draft text of the action plan. However, the NAP does not provide further details on how or which civil society organizations were consulted. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Slovenia and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP. 
The NAP was developed by Slovenia'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense; Ministry of the Interior; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Justice; and Ministry of Labor, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. 
NAP Implementation
The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in the implementation of the action plan. 
Several ministries, such as the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of the Interior, among others, are tasked with implementing various objectives of the NAP.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP indicates that non-governmental organizations and civil society will be invited to the inter-ministerial meetings at the working level to participate in the evaluation of the action plan. However, the NAP does not provide further details on how or which non-governmental and civil society organizations will be included in the monitoring and evaluation process.
The NAP indicates that Slovenia'ss Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be responsible for coordinating the preparation of evaluation reports. ",The implementation period of the NAP is two years (2018-2020).,"Slovenia'ss NAP identifies five overarching areas of focus for the implementation of the action plan:
Implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and the integration of gender in the peace and security policy;
Women involved in peace and security area;
Women and girls protection before the conflict, between and after the conflict, and elimination of sexual violence and gender based violence related to conflicts;
Education and training in the field of Women, Peace and Security Agenda;
Responsibility for the prevention and prosecution of perpetrators of sexual violence and gender based violence related to conflicts.","Slovenia'ss NAP identifies five overarching areas of focus, with each area having its corresponding activity. For example, focus #5, ""Responsibility for the prevention and prosecution of perpetrators of sexual violence and gender based violence related to conflicts,” lists ""Commitment to prosecute those responsible for sexual violence and gender based violence, and to eliminate the culture of impunity within international forums, even when dealing with individual situations or countries” as an activity.","Slovenia'ss NAP identifies five overarching areas of focus, with each area having corresponding activities, operators, and indicators. For example, activity #1 under the objective to end impunity for sexual and gender-based violence lists ""appearances and statements of male and female representatives of the Republic of Slovenia, which include the importance of prosecution of those responsible for gender based crimes and the elimination of the culture of impunity in discussions in the UN (NATO, SSR and other UN bodies), NATO, the EU and the OSCE at various levels or at international events related to this area” as an indicator.","Slovenia'ss NAP will be evaluated through a two-step process: 1) A reporting system and 2) Meetings of relevant governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. Two annual reports will be prepared in 2018 and 2019 to monitor the implementation of the NAP. Additionally, a final report, with an overview of the implementation and recommendations for the future, will be prepared after the NAP'ss expiration period. Furthermore, implementation will also be evaluated through biannual inter-ministerial meetings. The NAP indicates that additional meetings will be convened, if needed.","The NAP does not contain an allocated or estimated budget. However, the NAP does mention financial support for the implementation of the WPS Agenda at the international level. Specifically, the NAP mentions ""financial support to the various mechanisms of international organizations that support Implementation of Women, Peace and Security Agenda” and ""earmarking relevant contributions that are not directly related to the topic of women, peace and security, in the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda (example: the financial contribution of the Republic of Slovenia in support of the Afghan security forces was used specifically for the needs of the female members of the Afghan Security Forces).”","The NAP mentions disarmament once under the goal of ""promoting gender mainstreaming in areas related to peace and security” within the context of Slovenia'ss participation in discussions on international organizations and events, including disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration. Otherwise, the NAP does not have a substantive engagement with or plan of action to address issues of disarmament and demilitarization.","Constitution 1991: Laws > Violence against women > Constitutional provision

The NAP identifies gender mainstreaming in conflict prevention and resolution, including through strengthening women'ss role in preventing conflict and post-conflict reconstruction; increasing the number of women in peacekeeping missions; and protection of women and girls from and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence in conflict and post-conflict settings. While similar in areas of focus, the second NAP expands these objectives. Whereas the first NAP does not focus on disarmament, for instance, the second NAP mentions promoting gender mainstreaming in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration DDR efforts. Additionally, the second NAP provides an overview of accomplishments in implementing the first NAP, both domestically and internationally, including through quantifiable measures. Nevertheless, the NAP does not specifically identify lessons learned in terms of challenges encountered during the first NAP'ss implementation. Furthermore, while financing WPS actions is addressed within the second NAP, neither action plan has an allocated budget. Slovenia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 after a brief conflict also referred to as the ""Ten-Day War between Yugoslav and Slovenian forces. The country has not had a history of conflict since then. Slovenia is a contributor to overseas military missions and peacekeeping operations. Additionally, a previous member of NATO'ss Partnership for Peace Program , Slovenia became a full member of NATO in 2004. At the national level, in 2015, Slovenia'ss Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities adopted a set of Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming in the Work of Ministries. In 2016, Slovenia established the Advocate of the Principle of Equality, which is an independent body charged with gender equality. Slovenia'ss NAP identifies five overarching areas of focus for the implementation of the action plan: Implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and the integration of gender in the peace and security policy; Women involved in peace and security area; Women and girls protection before the conflict, between and after the conflict, and elimination of sexual violence and gender based violence related to conflicts; Education and training in the field of Women, Peace and Security Agenda; Responsibility for the prevention and prosecution of perpetrators of sexual violence and gender based violence related to conflicts. Slovenia'ss NAP identifies five overarching areas of focus, with each area having its corresponding activity. For example, focus 5, ""Responsibility for the prevention and prosecution of perpetrators of sexual violence and gender based violence related to conflicts, lists ""Commitment to prosecute those responsible for sexual violence and gender based violence, and to eliminate the culture of impunity within international forums, even when dealing with individual situations or countries as an activity. Slovenia'ss NAP identifies five overarching areas of focus, with each area having corresponding activities, operators, and indicators. For example, activity 1 under the objective to end impunity for sexual and gender-based violence lists ""appearances and statements of male and female representatives of the Republic of Slovenia, which include the importance of prosecution of those responsible for gender based crimes and the elimination of the culture of impunity in discussions in the UN NATO, SSR and other UN bodies, NATO, the EU and the OSCE at various levels or at international events related to this area as an indicator. Slovenia'ss NAP will be evaluated through a two-step process: 1 A reporting system and 2 Meetings of relevant governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. Two annual reports will be prepared in 2018 and 2019 to monitor the implementation of the NAP. Additionally, a final report, with an overview of the implementation and recommendations for the future, will be prepared after the NAP'ss expiration period. Furthermore, implementation will also be evaluated through biannual inter-ministerial meetings. The NAP indicates that additional meetings will be convened, if needed. The NAP does not contain an allocated or estimated budget. However, the NAP does mention financial support for the implementation of the WPS Agenda at the international level. Specifically, the NAP mentions ""financial support to the various mechanisms of international organizations that support Implementation of Women, Peace and Security Agenda and ""earmarking relevant contributions that are not directly related to the topic of women, peace and security, in the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda example: the financial contribution of the Republic of Slovenia in support of the Afghan security forces was used specifically for the needs of the female members of the Afghan Security Forces. The NAP mentions disarmament once under the goal of ""promoting gender mainstreaming in areas related to peace and security within the context of Slovenia'ss participation in discussions on international organizations and events, including disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration. Otherwise, the NAP does not have a substantive engagement with or plan of action to address issues of disarmament and demilitarization."
158,Solomon Islands,28,0,1,,22.4,"Solomon Islands adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2021. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs, and supported by the Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace, the Ministry of Police, Corrections and National Security, and the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force with technical and financial support by the Government of Australia, UN Women, and UNDP for the during the NAP development process. The NAP acknowledges the importance of civil society involvement in the implementation of the WPS agenda, but does not specify details on civil society involvement in the country'ss NAP. The NAP aims to support the recommendations made by the previous Truth and Reconciliation Commission, specifically as it pertains to women and girls, CEDAW General Recommendation 30, and the entire WPS agenda, including access to government services, protection, prevention and rehabilitation with the promise that a commitment to women'ss rights will be reflected in ""all related policies, programs and budgets, including the resources [the Solomon Islands] invest in recovery and reparation.” The NAP does not include an allocated budget, but indicates that a financing and implementation plan will be developed in the first six months of the NAP timeline. Solomon Islands gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1978. The most recent history of armed conflict in Solomon Islands was a period of civil unrest known locally as "" The Tensions ,” which lasted from 1998 until 2003, when the Townsville Peace Agreement was signed. The conflict had a disproportionate impact on women and girls, who were deliberately targeted with violence, the reverberations of which continue to this date, including through the societal impacts of post-conflict trauma. During the Tensions, women played a key role in peacemaking using traditional practices and churches to mediate and place pressure on parties to disarm, as well as a role providing social, spiritual and material support to one another and to combatants. Despite these efforts, women were excluded from the peace agreement negotiations and amnesty was given to all actors, depriving women and girls and other affected people access to justice and accountability. Currently, the Solomon Islands is affected by environmental challenges such as increasing climate temperatures, rising sea levels, commercial logging, food (in)security for increasing populations with decreasing agricultural viability, and the destabilization of communities.",2002,,,,"NAP Development
The National Action Plan states that collaboration with civil society is needed to implement women, peacebuilding, and participation. Women civil society actors are not particularly acknowledged as having played a substantive role in shaping the plan. However, the document mentions that it reflects the ""current context and priorities in Solomon Islands and has been shaped and endorsed by government ministries, provincial stakeholders, civil society, women's groups and churches at all levels”.
The NAP was launched by the Ministry of Women, Youth, Children & Family Affairs (MWYFCA) of the Solomon Islands through a consultative and collaborative process led by the Ministry of Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs, and the support of the Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace, the Ministry of Police, Corrections and National Security, and the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. The Government of Australia, UN Women, and UNDP provided technical and financial support during the NAP development process.
NAP Implementation
Overall implementation of the National Action Plan is to be overseen by the Ministry of Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs through its Women's Development Division (WDD). A Resource and Implementation Plan with a list of financial resources and operational support needed for implementation by relevant ministries and partners was planned to be developed in the first six months of the NAP's timeframe. The role of civil society in supporting or monitoring implementation is vague.
The role of women in peace and security is one of the seven priority outcomes of the National Gender Equality and Women Development Policy 2016-2020 (NGEWD), and the coordination of the implementation of the NAP will be led by the MWYFCA, the government Ministry responsible for advancing gender equality and promoting women's empowerment. The NAP will be implemented through national and provincial institutions and processes, in close cooperation with communities, civil society organisations, and development partners. MWYCFA will play the key leadership and coordination role in the implementation of action items across government, and lead on implementation of action items assigned to them in the Action and Results Matrix.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation 
A national WPS Steering and Monitoring Group was slated to be established to oversee progress on the implementation of the National Action Plan on WPS. This group is meant to review data on strategies and actions, and provide recommendations to inform implementation, track results, and contribute to reporting on progress. Reporting is to follow requirements from CEDAW, the National Gender Equality and Women's Development (GEWD) Policy 2016-2020, which, as one of its seven outcomes, specifies recognition of the role of women in maintaining peace and national security; and the National Peacebuilding Policy. The NAP also notes that periodic reporting on CEDAW will contribute to impact assessment of efforts toward achieving substantive equality. It is not clear from the NAP what specific role  civil society has in M&E efforts. The NAP does mention that as multi stakeholder, multisectorial initiative, the NAP requires the collective effort of diverse partners, including government, civil society, communities, the UN system and development partners. The NAP will be implemented through national and provincial institutions and processes, in close cooperation with communities, civil society organisations, and development partners.",The NAP is to cover four years of implementation from 2017-2021.,"The Solomon Islands's NAP is broken down into four pillars: Participation, Protection, Prevention, and Recovery and Reconciliation. Designed to cover the WPS agenda pillars, this section delineates the required actions and expected results.
Participation: Women's participation, representation and decision-making in peace and security are expanded at all levels:
1.1. Expanding formal mechanisms for women's participation and the reflection of women's priorities in peace and security institutions, policy agendas, budgets, and progress monitoring, including rural, remote, urban, disabled, and young women and girls.  
1.2. Increasing women's representation in national peace and security decision-making and establish quotas to address the multiple barriers to women's participation.   
1.3 Strengthen capacities and increase resources to ensure gender equality and women's empowerment are central to security institutions and mechanisms, peacebuilding and conflict prevention activities, at all levels.
Protection: Women'ss human rights are protected, and women are secured from sexual and gender based violence:
2.1. Strengthen the protection of women and girls by building the capacity of government and civil society actors, including traditional leaders and those responding to humanitarian crises
2.2 Ensure Solomon Islands ongoing transitional justice processes respect women's rights, address gender-based violations, and are inclusive of rural and remote women.   
2.3 Combat impunity for gender based violence and ensure protection of women's human rights, including through prosecuting perpetrators.
Prevention: Solomon Islands actively prevents conflict and violence against women and girls:
3.1 Implement reforms in security institutions that prioritise VAW prevention, respond to women's diverse security concerns, and respect women's rights.
3.2 Challenge discriminatory gender norms, attitudes and behaviour, including through working with men and boys.
3.3 Decrease the risk of sexual and gender-based violence and conflict during periods of natural disaster, humanitarian crisis and instability.
Recovery and Reconciliation: Women and girls priorities and rights are reflected in all development and peace building:
4.1 Strengthen women's agency and capacities in recovery and reconciliation processes.
4.2 Promote equitable peace and recovery processes","Each objective of the NAP outlines actions for achieving the overall elements of the plan. Each are elaborated on in the Action and Results Matrix (ARM). For example, under the protection pillar, the ARM contains the following actions:
Sensitise traditional and religious leaders on gender equality and women's rights principles, relevant national laws and international instruments, including CEDAW and UNSCR 1325 to ensure the traditional justice system consistently delivers equal protection for the rights of women and girls.
Provide technical guidance and capacity building on gender and security issues to all uniformed officers, including Immigration and. border enforcement/ protection staff
Include women from border communities in policy consultations and border agreement talks, to ensure identification of women's protection and conflict prevention priorities, including issues related to economic security and cross-border trade, trafficking, arms and GBV.   
Build women and men'ss capacities to facilitate community dialogue, including disseminating findings and recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report to affected communities.
Work with women victims/ survivors to develop strategies to redress conflict related rights violations, with a specific focus on SGBV, that take into account inter- national principles and standards of administration of justice and reparations.
Ensure justice mechanisms that consider conflict-related cases, including special courts, are accessible to women survivors in rural and remote areas, and that these prioritise women's human rights violations.",The NAP does not identify indicators which measure the actions that will lead to the expected results outlined in the plan.,"Intention for creating a M&E plan is mentioned in the NAP, but there is no breakdown of what this consists of or the timeline for such a process.","There is no projected budget provided in the NAP. The NAP states that a Resource and Implementation Plan outlining the financial resources and operational support needed for implementation by relevant ministries and partners, and sequencing and prioritisation of all Actions, will be developed in the first six months of the NAP's timeframe.

For transparency and context, the NAP provides details on how the process stalled and then was revived in 2011, 2015, and in 2018 to finalize it. On page 59 there is a timeline that shows the many steps taken towards the NAP from 2009 to the present day.
The three departments that led the process of the NAP are the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, the Department of Defence and Military Veterans and the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. There is a National Steering Committee, formed by government and CSO representatives, that facilitated the consultations in the development process. There is a proposed governance model (pg 84), and the NAP also contains an acknowledgements section that acknowledges the different stakeholders who contributed. There were provincial consultations and a national consultative workshop, and a Drafting Team was formed. There were further consultations on the zero draft in 2019.
Civil society in South Africa long advocated for a NAP and also was instrumental in the process of reviving the 2020-2025 NAP'ss development. They formed a steering group to collate the inputs of different stakeholders to the process, and engaged in the multi-stakeholder consultative meeting. On page 43, there is a list of points that emerged from civil society dialogues on WPS, which were incorporated into the NAP. 
The NAP states that implementation will be coordinated by the three ministries above,as well as other important departments identified that include police, corrections, DPME, and the presidential policy unit. Civil society and other representatives will also serve on this committee, as will the National Focal Point on WPS. 
Each year, a National Policy Forum with representatives from government, civil society, academia, private sector and development partners will meet and evaluate progress towards the NAP'ss stated objectives.",The implementation period for the South African National Action Plan is 2020-2025.,"The main principle underpinning the NAP is the link between state security and human security, as well as the idea that peace and security for women ""must be accompanied by larger transformative processes, behavioural change, and peace and security for the society at large”. It is anchored on the four main WPS pillars of protection, participation, prevention, and relief and recovery. Key terms are identified in the NAP to provide a basis for common understanding of terminology. 
There are several main objectives:
To promote, protect and respect an inclusive, safe and peaceful society by operationalising the WPS Agenda in South Africa;
To implement, evaluate and report on agreed upon WPS frameworks at international, continental and regional levels;
To ensure the full and meaningful participation of women in peace and security processes, structures and institutions at all levels;
To establish and implement effective conflict management institutions, systems and processes;
To prevent violence against women, girls and gender non-conforming persons and protect them in all situations;
To position and promote South Africa as a credible international leader on issues related to WPS;
To ensure an integrated and coordinated approach to, and the utilisation of best practices towards information and knowledge management for WPS.","Within the four WPS pillars, the National Action Plan lists seven priority areas and 21 specific strategic objectives. 
Under Pillar 1 on Participation, there are two priorities: To develop, implement and assess gender-sensitive laws, policies and strategies; and to Ensure meaningful participation of women in peace processes, structures and institutions. Under Pillar 1 Priority 1, there are two objectives: Ensure effective participation of civil society; and Enhance accountability for the implementation of the WPS NAP.
The priorities under the other pillars are as follows:
Prevention: Create an inclusive, peaceful and safe society; Prevention measures for safer societies; Empowering women and comprehending their needs.
Protection: Enhance the protection of women, girls and gender non-conforming persons from all forms of abuse, violence and discrimination.
Relief and Recovery: The provision of safe spaces of refuge for victims of humanitarian crises.
Under each of these priorities, there are multiple activities, expected outcomes, indicators and means of verification, time frame, and key actors. Some examples of activities include: 
Review the foreign policy and ensure it is gender-sensitive
Establish a National Policy Forum on WPS from the three spheres of government, civil society and the private sector that feeds into the security cluster
Strengthen the relevant parliamentary oversight committees to ensure the implementation of WPS
Provide family support and family planning educational campaigns and programmes
Provide trauma-informed counselling at family clinics
Develop awareness programmes and concrete measures to address the violent expressions of Homophobia
Develop awareness programmes and concrete measures to prevent xenophobia","Under each of the activities there are indicators listed. For example, under Strategic Objective 1.2.2 Women's representation and participation in national peace and security structures, there is an indicator ""Peace tables held on a biennial basis.” Each indicator corresponds to a timeframe, relevant actors, and expected outcomes. 
The full matrix of priorities, activities, and indicators can be found starting on page 64.","The DPME will support the development of a full monitoring and evaluation plan, which will facilitate the tracking of progress towards implementation. The NAP states that all stakeholders will be expected to report on their work towards NAP implementation. To better support this, the NAP aligns with priorities that were outlined in the 2019 State of the Nation Address, and indicators align with the AU continental results framework. Gender activities will be viewed not as new work but are meant to be mainstreamed in existing systems and initiatives.","The NAP contains a budget, and there will be comprehensive costing in alignment with the Gender-Responsive Planning, Budgeting, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Auditing framework. The total estimated budget for the NAP will be 560,000,000 ZAR. The NAP acknowledges that the South African economy is not doing well so funding is difficult, but states that South Africa will be proactively looking to channel resources.","There is one activity on disarmament in the NAP, ""Ensure more women are trained in gender and disarmament and participate in international forums on the topic”. This is under Strategic Objective 1.2.1, Women's representation and participation at international and continental peace and security structures and processes.","Commission for Gender Equality: Institutional mechanisms

For example, under Strategic Objective 1.2.2 Women's representation and participation in national peace and security structures, there is an indicator ""Peace tables held on a biennial basis. Each indicator corresponds to a timeframe, relevant actors, and expected outcomes. The full matrix of priorities, activities, and indicators can be found starting on page 64. The DPME will support the development of a full monitoring and evaluation plan, which will facilitate the tracking of progress towards implementation. The NAP states that all stakeholders will be expected to report on their work towards NAP implementation. To better support this, the NAP aligns with priorities that were outlined in the 2019 State of the Nation Address, and indicators align with the AU continental results framework. Gender activities will be viewed not as new work but are meant to be mainstreamed in existing systems and initiatives. The NAP contains a budget, and there will be comprehensive costing in alignment with the Gender-Responsive Planning, Budgeting, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Auditing framework. The total estimated budget for the NAP will be 560,000,000 ZAR. The NAP acknowledges that the South African economy is not doing well so funding is difficult, but states that South Africa will be proactively looking to channel resources. There is one activity on disarmament in the NAP, ""Ensure more women are trained in gender and disarmament and participate in international forums on the topic. This is under Strategic Objective 1.2.1, Women's representation and participation at international and continental peace and security structures and processes."
161,South Sudan,27,1,0,,,"South Sudan adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015 for the period 2015-2020. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW) through a participatory process that included broad consultations with various peace and security stakeholders and supported by UN Women. Additionally, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) acted as the co-chair of the development process, collecting and harmonizing views from government institutions, development partners, United Nations agencies, civil society organisations, women'ss groups and religious and traditional leaders. The overall goal of the NAP is to strengthen the participation of women in peace and security efforts and facilitate the creation of an enabling environment for their leadership and political participation in conflict resolution and allow for more inclusive, just and sustainable peace, recovery and reconstruction processes, where a gender perspective is integrated into the design and implementation of all policies related to peace and security. The NAP has an implementation matrix that breaks down objectives to corresponding actions, outcomes, indicators, key actors, and a time frame. Nevertheless, the NAP does not have an allocated budget, instead tasking implementing actors to develop a financing plan. South Sudan reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country reported that the Gender Machinery in South Sudan is monitoring the implementation of the NAP as well as the Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs) on gender-based violence (GBV) among other human rights violations. South Sudan additionally reported on women'ss participation in peace in the country. In the build-up to the renewed peace efforts, 43 South Sudanese women organizations and other NGOs working on women empowerment and peace signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on October 21, 2018 to collaborate and work together. In the renewed 2018 peace effort, one of the mediators was a woman and female leaders of civil society groups served as official observers. Women made up 25 percent of official delegates, and members of the Women'ss Coalition (p. 82). South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011. The most recent armed conflict in the country'ss history was the civil war , which lasted from 2013 until 2018 and resulted in thousands of casualties and displaced people. The war had a disproportionate impact on women, with sexual violence used as a weapon of war. Women made concerted efforts to be included in the peace process and had relative success in their efforts. Women comprised 15% of delegates leading the negotiations for the 2015 peace agreement while women comprised 25% of delegates during the 2018 negotiations. While all signatories representing conflict parties in the 2018 peace agreement were men, women constituted seven out of 17 (41%) of civil society signatories.",,,,86.5M,"NAP Development
Civil society organisations and women'ss groups and religious participated in the participatory process of developing the NAP in South Sudan, including through consultation with the various peace and security stakeholders and supported by UN WOMEN. The process, led by the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW), with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). Civil society organisations were also included in the National Steering Committee that led the development of the NAP. At the same time, no specific civil society organisations were mentioned in the NAP.                           
WILPF does not have a country section in South Sudan and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP.  
The NAP has been developed through a rigorous participatory process involving broad consultation of various peace and security stakeholders and supported by UN WOMEN. The process, led by the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW), with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) as the co-chair, has collected and harmonised views from government institutions, development partners, United Nations agencies, civil society organisations, women'ss groups and religious and traditional leaders.      
NAP Implementation
The National Steering Committee, that includes civil society organisations,  coordinate and monitors the South Sudanese NAP implementation. Civil society organisations also listed as the key actors for implementations of strategic objectives of the NAP under each category.
To facilitate the identification of priority areas of immediate action for improving the lives of women and children in South Sudan and ensuring increased investment for strengthened implementation of UNSCR 1325, a National Steering Committee comprised of government ministries, commissions, United Nations agencies and civil society organisations was formed. The National Steering Committee, which will continue to coordinate and monitor the South Sudan National Action Plan implementation, is chaired by the the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW).
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society does not have a specific role in monitoring and evaluation of the NAP implementation.
Implementation of the National Action Plan for UNSCR 1325 will be monitored by an inter-ministerial committee comprised of ve Government ministries, namely, the MGCSW, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. The Inter-Ministerial Committee will be chaired by the MGCSW, with the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Justice as co-chairs, and will meet twice a year (every six months) to evaluate the progress of National Action Plan implementation and receive the mid-year reports from the National Steering Committee. The Inter-Ministerial Committee will also receive and approve the National Annual Report on UNSCR 1325 and submit it to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who will then present it to the Council of Ministers to have it tabled for debate in Parliament.",The implementation period for the Sudanese National Plan of Action is five years (2015-2020).,"The National Action Plan is based on the mandate of UNSCR 1325 and the activities to be implemented fall under the four pillars of the resolution, as follows:
Prevention: Reduction in con ict and all forms of structural and physical violence against women, particularly sexual and gender-based violence;
Participation: Inclusion of women and women'ss interests in decision-making processes related to the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts;
Protection: Women'ss safety, physical and mental health and economic security are assured and their human rights respected; and   
Relief and recovery: Women'ss specific needs are met in conflict and post-conflict situations.","Each pillar has different actions assigned. For example, Strategic Goal 1 (Increase women'ss effective participation in leadership and peacebuilding and strengthen gender perspectives in the South Sudan'ss state-building and reconstruction processes)  includes the following actions:   
Examine and review all laws, policies and programmes within South Sudan'ss socio-economic and political context in order to promote and guarantee equal opportunities and active and meaningful participation of women in politics and in positions of power and decision-making positions, taking into consideration the special needs and interests of women with disabilities;           
Promote equal access and opportunities for women and girls, including those with disabilities, to education, vocational and technical training, in-service training and skills development by deliberately addressing the roots of their poverty to enable them to engage in meaningful employment, attain economic empowerment and effectively participate in the country'ss rebuilding and democratic processes;
Improve women'ss economic status by ensuring that reconstruction programmes undertaken in South Sudan equitably benefit women and girls, including those with disabilities; women are invited to participate and contribute to government and donor discussions and decisions taken on recovery and reconstruction projects to be financed and implemented;
Actively involve women in the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programme and ensure that all those involved in planning for DDR consider the different needs of female and male ex-combatants and the WAAF/G, and take into account the needs of their dependents.","Each strategic goal has a number of listed indicators. For example, the first goal, ""Review all laws (statutory and customary) that undermine or hinder women'ss participation in decision-making and governance in their bid to actively engage in South Sudan'ss recovery, development and democratic processes ”, includes several indicators:
Number of laws reviewed;
Number of sensitization campaigns held to consult with and inform traditional leaders and communities on negative cultural practices that hinder women'ss leadership potential;
Number of women actively involved in governance and recovery processes.","The Inter-Ministerial Committee meets twice a year (every six months) to evaluate the progress of National Action Plan implementation and receive the mid-year reports from the National Steering Committee. The Inter-Ministerial Committee also receives and approves the National Annual Report on UNSCR 1325 and submits it to the Minister of Foreign A airs, who will then present it to the Council of Ministers to have it tabled for debate in Parliament. Every two years the Government compiles a report on UNSCR 1325 and submitS it to the United Nations Secretary General as required under the resolution. A mid-term evaluation of implementation will be conducted in 2016 after the compilation of the report to the United Nations Secretary General and a final review will be prepared in the fourth year (2018) to pave the way for the development of a revised National Action Plan.","Based on the National Action Plan, government institutions and implementing partners will develop detailed activity plans related to their areas of operation and budget for these activities, as well as take full financial responsibility for their implementation.
The proposed National Action Plan activities are not restrictive and the exibility provided for allows room for stakeholders to adjust their programming so as to rapidly respond to changing environments and conflict-related developments in the country. This flexibility also permits the different actors to utilise new windows of opportunity in funding that may emerge in the course of this action plan'ss years. ","Strategic Objective 4 under the Strategic Goal 1 (Increase women'ss effective participation in leadership and peacebuilding and strengthen gender perspectives in the South Sudan'ss state-building and reconstruction processes) assigns all relevant actors to actively involve women in the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programme and ensure that all those involved in planning for DDR consider the different needs of female and male ex-combatants and take into account the needs of their dependents.","Section 22 of The Child Act - Right to Protection from Abuse: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

162,Spain,3,1,1,,,"Spain adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2023. The NAP was developed by an Interministerial Working Group with the overarching goal to ""contribute to ensuring the protection of the human rights of women and girls, and their substantive participation in conflict prevention, as well as achieving and consolidating peace” (p. 16). The NAP highlights that UNSCR 2242 (2015) was approved during Spain'ss presidency of the Security Council, underscoring the importance of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda for Spain. The NAP stresses the importance of the agentive status of women, emphasizing the importance of gender equality for the full implementation of WPS commitments. The NAP takes both a national and international approach to the implementation of the WPS Agenda, with particular focus on tackling the commitments holistically and promoting the interlinkages between gender equality reforms during implementation. Additionally, the NAP promotes an integrated agenda by demonstrating the links of the WPS Agenda to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with particular emphasis on SDGs 5 and 16 on gender equality and peace and justice, respectively. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include a substantive monitoring and evaluation framework or an allocated budget. Spain'ss most recent NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2007, without a specific period of implementation. The first NAP had six overarching goals. While two of these goals focused on peacekeeping missions, the remaining goals focused on strengthening gender-sensitive peacebuilding; protecting the human rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict states; increasing women in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts; and encouraging the participation of Spanish civil society in the implementation of Resolution 1325. The second NAP expands on these goals by contextualizing the changing dynamics of international peace and security since the adoption of the country'ss first NAP. Specifically, human rights and gender equality hold a more prevalent place in the revised NAP as well as links to the 2030 Agenda. Additionally, the second NAP expands its focus on disarmament by going beyond analyzing the issue from the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts alone, and instead identifies gender mainstreaming in the non-proliferation of small arms and light weapons as an action item among its objectives. Spain reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country included the following update: ""The NAP provides for the creation of a Consultative Group composed of the Ministries involved and civil society organizations, which will hold regular meetings in order to, on the one hand, maintain the intensity in the implementation of the plan and, on the other hand, evaluate its results and adapt its application to new elements. The Plan also provides for follow-up reports to be submitted to Parliament every two years. Since the first follow-up report is due in 2019, information is currently being gathered on progress, activities carried out and the budget executed, and meetings are planned with both the Ministries involved and civil society” (p. 62) The most recent armed conflict in Spain'ss history was its long-lasting conflict with ETA (an acronym for Euskadi ta Askatasuna [Basque Homeland and Liberty]), an armed separatist organization founded in 1959 with the aim to establish an independent Basque state. The conflict resulted in hundreds of casualties until ETA'ss announcement of a unilateral ceasefire and its disbanding in 2011 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, Spain was among the top 20 countries with the highest military expenditure as well as being among the top 10 arms exporters in the world. Spain is a contributor to humanitarian aid, including as a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Spain is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Spain most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2015-2016.",1984,8,2014,17B,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that civil society has been included in the development of the NAP through meetings with representatives from key associations (research and study centers, development organizations, and feminist organizations and women'ss associations) that work in the WPS field. 
Additionally, the following organizations have also contributed to the development of the NAP: Alianza Por la Solidaridad (APS); Centro de Estudios e Investigación sobre Mujeres (CEIM); Forum de Política Feminista (FpF); Mujeres en Zona de Conflicto (MZC); Human Rights Office, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC); Real Instituto Elcano; Spanish Women in International Security (SWIIS); Women'ss International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF España). 
The NAP was developed by an Interministerial Working Group that consists of the following ministries: Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (MAEC), Ministry of Defence (MDEF), Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (MECD), Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MEIC), Ministry of the Interior (MINT), Ministry of Justice (MJUS), Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality (MSSSI), and the Ministry of Employment and Social Security (MEYSS).
NAP Implementation
The NAP indicates that civil society organizations in Spain and their local counterparts in countries where the NAP will be implemented are key partners in implementing the NAP. However, the document does not specify which civil society organizations will be represented or how they will contribute to the implementation of the NAP. 
The NAP will be implemented by an Interministerial Working Group.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP implementation will be monitored by an Interministerial Working Group, which will also include representatives from civil society organizations. Civil society will also be represented on the consultative group, which will meet with the working group at least once a year.
The NAP implementation will be monitored by an Interministerial Working Group.",The implementation period of the NAP is six years (2017-2023).,"The NAP has four overarching objectives (which are then broken down to specific objectives on a detailed implementation matrix): 
Mainstream the gender perspective in peacebuilding and the prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts.
Achieve the significant participation of women in decision-making processes regarding the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts.
Guarantee the protection of, and respect for, the human rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations.
Effectively introduce gender mainstreaming into the definition of specific measures on reparations for, and the recovery of, conflict victims.","The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that breaks down each overarching objective with corresponding specific objectives, actions, indicators, and actors. For example, objective 2.3, ""Promote the participation of local women in the peace negotiation delegations of parties in conflict to ensure that women'ss needs are included in peace agreements” lists ""Promote, together with other coun-tries, the greater inclusion of local women in the delegations of parties negotiating peace in their countries” as an action item (p. 25). ","The NAP identifies several performance indicators for each objective, outlined on the implementation matrix. For example, objective 2.3, ""Promote the participation of local women in the peace negotiation delegations of parties in conflict to ensure that women'ss needs are included in peace agreements” lists ""Number of meetings held with women and women'ss associations by Embassies, Technical Cooperation Offices, and Counsellor'ss Offices for specific sectors, broken down geographically” as one of the four indicators for this objective (p. 25).","The NAP indicates that a working group will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the action plan. The group will hold a plenary meeting at least once a year and will prepare a monitoring and assessment report every two years to be presented to the Spanish Parliament. However, the NAP does not include a formal monitoring and evaluation framework.","The NAP indicates that the action plan ""will be carried out within the framework of the annual ordinary budget” (p. 44). However, the NAP does not include an estimated or allocated budget.","The NAP indicates that Spain'ss revised action plan is a driving force behind ""incorporating the principal of equal treatment and opportunities for women and men in the planning and implementation of activities for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration” (p. 8). Additionally, disarmament is mentioned twice in the action items listed for objectives 4.1 and 4.4 (both objectives list the same action item): ""Encourage gender mainstreaming in initiatives for disarmament and the non-proliferation of small arms and light weapons, as well as the participation of women in these initiatives” (pp. 31-32).","Constitutional Act 8/1983: Laws > Violence against women > Legislation

",3,Western Europe,"Spain adopted its most recent National Action Plan NAP in 2017 for the period 2017-2023. The NAP was developed by an Interministerial Working Group with the overarching goal to ""contribute to ensuring the protection of the human rights of women and girls, and their substantive participation in conflict prevention, as well as achieving and consolidating peace p. 16. The NAP highlights that UNSCR 2242 2015 was approved during Spain'ss presidency of the Security Council, underscoring the importance of the Women, Peace, and Security WPS Agenda for Spain. The NAP stresses the importance of the agentive status of women, emphasizing the importance of gender equality for the full implementation of WPS commitments. The NAP takes both a national and international approach to the implementation of the WPS Agenda, with particular focus on tackling the commitments holistically and promoting the interlinkages between gender equality reforms during implementation. Additionally, the NAP promotes an integrated agenda by demonstrating the links of the WPS Agenda to the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs, with particular emphasis on SDGs 5 and 16 on gender equality and peace and justice, respectively. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include a substantive monitoring and evaluation framework or an allocated budget. Spain'ss most recent NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2007, without a specific period of implementation. The first NAP had six overarching goals. While two of these goals focused on peacekeeping missions, the remaining goals focused on strengthening gender-sensitive peacebuilding; protecting the human rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict states; increasing women in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration DDR efforts; and encouraging the participation of Spanish civil society in the implementation of Resolution 1325. The second NAP expands on these goals by contextualizing the changing dynamics of international peace and security since the adoption of the country'ss first NAP. Specifically, human rights and gender equality hold a more prevalent place in the revised NAP as well as links to the 2030 Agenda. Additionally, the second NAP expands its focus on disarmament by going beyond analyzing the issue from the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration DDR efforts alone, and instead identifies gender mainstreaming in the non-proliferation of small arms and light weapons as an action item among its objectives. Spain reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing25 and in preparation for CSW64 2020. Specifically, the country included the following update: ""The NAP provides for the creation of a Consultative Group composed of the Ministries involved and civil society organizations, which will hold regular meetings in order to, on the one hand, maintain the intensity in the implementation of the plan and, on the other hand, evaluate its results and adapt its application to new elements. The Plan also provides for follow-up reports to be submitted to Parliament every two years. Since the first follow-up report is due in 2019, information is currently being gathered on progress, activities carried out and the budget executed, and meetings are planned with both the Ministries involved and civil society p. 62 The most recent armed conflict in Spain'ss history was its long-lasting conflict with ETA an acronym for Euskadi ta Askatasuna Basque Homeland and Liberty, an armed separatist organization founded in 1959 with the aim to establish an independent Basque state. The conflict resulted in hundreds of casualties until ETA'ss announcement of a unilateral ceasefire and its disbanding in 2011 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, Spain was among the top 20 countries with the highest military expenditure as well as being among the top 10 arms exporters in the world. Spain is a contributor to humanitarian aid, including as a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Spain is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Spain most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2015-2016. The NAP has four overarching objectives which are then broken down to specific objectives on a detailed implementation matrix: Mainstream the gender perspective in peacebuilding and the prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts. Achieve the significant participation of women in decision-making processes regarding the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. Guarantee the protection of, and respect for, the human rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations. Effectively introduce gender mainstreaming into the definition of specific measures on reparations for, and the recovery of, conflict victims. The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that breaks down each overarching objective with corresponding specific objectives, actions, indicators, and actors. For example, objective 2.3, ""Promote the participation of local women in the peace negotiation delegations of parties in conflict to ensure that women'ss needs are included in peace agreements lists ""Promote, together with other coun-tries, the greater inclusion of local women in the delegations of parties negotiating peace in their countries as an action item p. 25. The NAP identifies several performance indicators for each objective, outlined on the implementation matrix. For example, objective 2.3, ""Promote the participation of local women in the peace negotiation delegations of parties in conflict to ensure that women'ss needs are included in peace agreements lists ""Number of meetings held with women and women'ss associations by Embassies, Technical Cooperation Offices, and Counsellor'ss Offices for specific sectors, broken down geographically as one of the four indicators for this objective p. 25. The NAP indicates that a working group will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the action plan. The group will hold a plenary meeting at least once a year and will prepare a monitoring and assessment report every two years to be presented to the Spanish Parliament. However, the NAP does not include a formal monitoring and evaluation framework. The NAP indicates that the action plan ""will be carried out within the framework of the annual ordinary budget p. 44. However, the NAP does not include an estimated or allocated budget. The NAP indicates that Spain'ss revised action plan is a driving force behind ""incorporating the principal of equal treatment and opportunities for women and men in the planning and implementation of activities for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration p. 8. Additionally, disarmament is mentioned twice in the action items listed for objectives 4.1 and 4.4 both objectives list the same action item: ""Encourage gender mainstreaming in initiatives for disarmament and the non-proliferation of small arms and light weapons, as well as the participation of women in these initiatives pp. 31-32."
163,Sri Lanka,4,1,1,,23.9,,1981,115,,1.56B,"Development
From the outset, it was determined that the ownership of the NAP on WPS should extend beyond the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment to other ministries, government entities, non-government entities, and the general populace of Sri Lanka. It was also determined that the NAP should reflect ground realities of Sri Lankan women, with particular attention to those impacted by conflict. To this end, provincial consultative dialogues were conducted in all nine provinces of Sri Lanka. These provincial consultations convened stakeholders from all twenty-five administrative districts of Sri Lanka.14 These stakeholders included: 
State officials working at the village, divisional, district, and provincial levels 
Representatives of civil society organizations (CSOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs), and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) 
Victim survivors of conflict, military widows, FHHs, women with disabilities, survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, ex- combatants of the LTTE, women working in the estate sector or fisheries, women providing care for partners and/or children with disabilities.
The methodology of the provincial consultative dialogues aimed to enable coordination between GoSL and CSOs. To ensure that the data gathered was clear and distinct, the consultations were held separately for State officials and representatives of CSOs. The issues raised by each group were then shared with the other at the consultations, to build consensus between the GoSL and CSOs towards the collaborative implementation of the NAP. Many of the issues identified in the NAP on WPS and the actions proposed to address them were drawn from the valuable sharing of ideas that was facilitated during the provincial consultations. During this process, specific CSOs which were experienced in dealing with selected aspects of WPS were further consulted on their willingness to work with the State on implementing corresponding sections of the NAP, to which the response was largely favorable.
At the consultations, it was highlighted that effective coordination between State entities and the enhancement of inter-agency cooperation would not only lead to effective collaboration between State entities to achieve common goals, but that it would also reduce the duplication of tasks by state entities. This in turn, would lead to decreased costs around implementing various activities. The consultations also revealed the existing gaps relating to the WPS agenda which need to be addressed, and these have been translated into activities.
Implementation
Various agencies will be responsible for different activities in the NAP.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The Monitoring Framework for the NAP was developed within the frame of SDGs and inputs from diverse stakeholders at grassroots consultations. Two multi-agency and stakeholder coordinating bodies – Inter- Agency Coordination and Assessment Committee and National Core Steering Committee – will be established to oversee and fulfill key M&E responsibilities in parallel with the interventions. The Lead Implementing Agency for each activity will also conduct assessments. Each Coordination and Assessment Committee will be comprised of at least five persons with a limit of ten persons. The Coordination and Assessment Committee membership should include:
The convening agent representing the Lead Implementation Agency
One other member of the Lead Implementation Agency
At least one representative from each additional state actor identified for the relevant activity of the NAP
At least one representative from each non-state actor identified for the relevant activity 
At least one representative from Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment in cases where the above does not comprise of a representative of the same
At least one representative from the Department for Project Management and Monitoring
One expert jointly identified and appointed by other Committee members

170,Switzerland,2,1,1,,30.9,"Switzerland adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2022. The NAP was developed by the Interdepartmental Working Group (IDWG 1325) in consultation with Swiss representations abroad, Swiss civil society, and partner organisations. Furthermore, the NAP incorporated the recommendations of the civil society report ""1325 Reloaded” during the revision process. The NAP identifies five overarching goals: effective involvement of women in conflict prevention; women'ss participation in and influence on conflict resolution and peace processes; protection against sexual and gender-based violence in conflict, refugee and migration contexts; women'ss participation in peace missions and security policy; and multi- and bilateral commitment by Switzerland to women, peace and security. Furthermore, the fourth NAP includes a focus for greater participation by women in the prevention of violent extremism, since the passing of UNSCR 2242 (2015) as well as the incorporation of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 on gender equality. The NAP includes an additional focus on engaging men in women, peace and security work as well as calling for greater consideration of gender aspects in arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators as well as being accompanied by a monitoring and evaluation framework. The NAP does not have an allocated budget, but holds each organizational unit responsible for allocating a budget to their respective activities. Switzerland'ss fourth NAP is preceded by three other NAPs, adopted in 2007, 2010, and 2013 and implemented for the period 2007-2009; 2010-2012; and 2013-2016, respectively. Switzerland'ss engagement with the WPS agenda has become significantly more substantive with the adoption of its subsequent NAPs. Of particular notice is that each NAP begins with a section that provides an overview of the findings and recommendations from the implementation phases of prior NAPs. The second and third NAPs also have examples of NAP implementation, including a section on the Swiss government'ss small arms strategy in the latter. Switzerland'ss fourth NAP is unique in that it is the first time that civil society was included in the implementation of a NAP. The most recent NAP also has a slight expansion of its focus by not just approaching WPS implementation internationally, but also prioritizing the domestic country context with the goal to focus on the needs of women refugees in Switzerland. Switzerland reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided an overview of the novelties in their fourth NAP, while also elaborating on Switzerland'ss engagement with activities and initiatives pertaining to women in conflict. Switzerland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but plays an important role in international humanitarian and development operations. Switzerland has a long-standing policy of military neutrality and has a national Peace Policy , which focuses on the implementation of the country'ss long-standing commitment to the promotion of peace worldwide. Nevertheless, in 2019, Switzerland was among the top 40 countries with the highest military expenditure as well as being among the top 15 arms exporters in the world. Furthermore, Switzerland has mandatory military service for all able-bodied male citizens of the country as well as having the highest rate of firearm ownership in Europe and the third highest in the world. Switzerland is a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Switzerland was UN Women 'ss second-largest contributor of regular resources with USD 16.03 million and the seventh-largest contributor of total resources with USD 19.36 million. At the multilateral level, Switzerland is a candidate for a non-permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council for the period 2023-2024.",1997,18,2015,5B,"NAP Development
Civil society formed part of the development of the NAP through consultations. 
WILPF Switzerland was not involved in the development of the NAP.
The NAP was developed by members of the IDWG 1325 such as the Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), the Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA) and the Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) as well as Civil Society (CS).
NAP Implementation
Civil society is involved in the implementation of NAP 1325 through a specific project which aims among other things to raise awareness among policymakers and the public.
The Interdepartmental Working Group 1325 (IDWG 1325), headed by the FDFA'ss Human Security Division, is responsible for implementing the measures during the 2018–22 period. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society is mentioned to be part of the evaluation process through a participatory process.  
The IDWG meets at least twice a year to review implementation, exchange knowledge and if necessary adapt the NAP. ",The fourth NAP is to be implemented in a period of five years 2018-2022.,"UPDATE-2018: The main goals of the 2018-2022 NAP are:
Effective involvement of women in conflict prevention 
Women'ss participation in and influence on conflict resolution and peace processes 
Protection against sexual and gender-based violence in conflict, refugee and migration contexts
Women'ss participation in peace missions and security policy 
Multi- and bilateral commitment by Switzerland to women, peace and security
UPDATE-2016: The third revised NAP supersedes the country's previous commitments in this area.  The second revised NAP contained three goals while this third revised NAP contains five.  They include:
1) Greater participation of women in peacebuilding
2) Protection of the rights of women and girls during and after violent conflicts, and prevention of gender-based violence
3) Greater inclusion of a gender perspective during and after armed conflicts in emergency aid, reconstruction and in dealing with the past
4) Greater inclusion of a gender perspective in conflict prevention
5) Mainstreaming ""Women, Peace and Security” in the federal administration
Each goal is broken down by subordinate goals: 
Multilateral policy
Switzerland'ss personnel policy
Bilateral activities and peace policy programmes as well as programmes for fragile states
Switzerland's second revised NAP has three main goals:
1) Greater participation of women in peacebuilding.
2) Prevention of gender-based violence and protection of the needs of and rights of women and girls.
3) A gender sensitive approach to all peacebuilding projects and programs.","UPDATE-2018: Switzerland'ss 2018-2022 NAP has various activities assigned to achieve its objectives. For example, for the first objective ""effective involvement of women in conflict prevention ” includes subordinate goal 1.2:
The political and economic situation allows women to participate in political and peace processes.
UPDATE-2016: The third revised NAP supersedes the country's previous commitments in this area. This NAP contains five objectives and each has many actions.  For example, Goal 5, ""Mainstreaming ""Women, Peace and Security” in the federal administration"" includes subordinate goal 2.2:
The administration‘s gender networks contain, wherever possible, an equal number of men and women.
Switzerland's second NAP contains an action matrix / lograme with specific activities under the primary goals, lead agents and indicators. The below example is taken from Goal 2, ""Prevention of gender-based violence and protection of the needs and rights of women and girls.""","UPDATE-2018: Switzerland'ss 2018-2022 NAP has various activities assigned to achieve its objectives. For example, for the first objective ""Effective involvement of women in conflict prevention ” includes subordinate goal 1.2, ""the political and economic situation allows women to participate in political and peace processes"" and its indicators are:
Recommendations on context-specific socioeconomic empowerment of women as a prerequisite for their participation in political processes.
UPDATE-2016: The third revised NAP supersedes the country's previous commitments in this area. The NAP contains many indicators for each goal and subordinate goals. For example, Goal 5, ""Mainstreaming ""Women, Peace and Security” in the federal administration""  includes subordinate goal 3.3 ""Strengthening of cooperation with strategic partners in the area of gender mainstreaming"" and the indicators include:
Programmes of strategic partners include the gender perspective.
Contracts with strategic partners contain gender-specific targets.
The indicators in Switzerland's second revised NAP correlate with specific activities in the action matrix / log-frame. Most of the indicators are measurable but do not specify a timeframe.","UPDATE- 2018:
Under the joint leadership of the United Nations and International Organisations Division (UNIOD) and the Human Security Division (HSD), a brief annual report is drawn up setting out the most important successes and difficulties in implementing the NAP. This annual report provides input for the UN Secretary-General'ss report and, where relevant, for the country report to the CEDAW. An external evaluation of the NAP is carried out as part of a peer-review process.
The Working Group on 1325 meets annually to ensure the constant follow-up of implementation measures. These meetings are attended by at least one representative of each government department in charge of implementation. The Coordination Committee for Peace Policy is informed at its own follow-up meeting about the results of the annual meeting and the current status of the implementation efforts.
At the Gender and Peacebuilding Roundtables organized by the Centre for Peacebuilding representatives of non-governmental organizations involved in peacebuilding efforts will be informed about the annual meeting and the current status of implementation work.","UPDATE-2018: Each organisational unit is responsible for implementing the activities assigned to it, allocating a budget for the activities and submitting year-end reports, however, there is no specific budget outlined in the NAP","UPDATE-2018: The fourth revised NAP supersedes the country's previous commitments in this area. The fourth NAP makes reference to the gendered impact of the proliferation of small arms on women. Goal 4, on ""women'ss participation in peace missions and security policy ”, subordinate action 4 pushes for ""increased proportion of women and greater consideration of gender aspects in arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation” and its indicators are:
References to gender aspects in arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation training.
 Information on women'ss presence in the disarmament sector. 
UPDATE-2016:  The third revised NAP supersedes the country's previous commitments in this area. The third NAP makes reference to Switzerland's engagement in the Mine Action Service and acknowledges the gendered impact of the proliferation of small arms on women.  Goal 4, subordinate action 1.2 pushes for ""Integration of gender aspects into small arms control and international arms control"" with indicators including: 
Statements and sponsored instruments for tighter controls on small arms 
Commitment to the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty

Number of women involved in peace infrastructures, government institutions and public administrations;
Number of women sensitized to and engaged in decision-making  and political processes;

183,Uganda,26,1,1,58.5,20.7,"Uganda adopted its third National Action Plan (NAP) in 2021 for the period 2021-2025. It is preceded by two others, for the periods 2008-2010 and 2011-2015. In 2008, Uganda adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP). The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender Labor and Social Development and constitutes a part of a broader national strategic framework on the advancement of women; in particular, the five year National Action Plan on Women (2007) which set out priorities in peacebuilding, conflict resolution and the rights of women and girls to live free from violence. Relatedly, the NAP addresses the gendered impacts of small arms and light weapons as well as referencing Uganda'ss arms control and disarmament measures.  A second NAP was adopted for the period 2011-2015. A participatory development process was formulated as a roadmap to NAP III in January 2019, informed by the review and evaluation of the two previous Ugandan NAPs, as well as UN Women'ss 2015 global study on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325.  The NAP is implemented through a localisation strategy that is people-focused and bottom-up.  Rather than a prescriptive tool, it is intended to be ‘an essential guiding tool for different sectors's (p. 31) including governmental ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), NGOs and cultural institutions.  NAP III focuses on four core goals: all forms of violence prevented and conflicts resolved; good governance enhanced at all levels; natural and human-made disasters prevented and mitigated; systems and structures for the implementation and coordination of the NAP III strengthened. It has a comprehensive and detailed Monitoring and Evaluation Plan based on annual reporting from civil society, MDAs and district local governments, as well as a mid-term evaluation in 2023.  It also has an estimated total budget of 90,570,166,912 UGX . Uganda reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64. Specifically, Uganda stated that the country conducted an evaluation of the NAP, and a multi- stakeholder technical committee to develop a successor national action plan was put in place. The identified legal priority areas of the NAP were legal and policy frameworks; improved access to health and medical services and psychosocial services for GBV victims/survivors; women in leadership and decision making and prevention of GBV in Society; and budgetary allocations for implementation on UNSCR 1325. Local governments also developed and implemented peace action plans with support from civil society organizations. In the implementation of the plans, community members were assigned roles in conflict analysis, early warning, prevention and response. Uganda gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, after decades of colonial rule by the British Empire. Uganda experienced a military dictatorship from 1971 until 1979, a civil war, which lasted from 1980 until 1986, as well as a protracted conflict between the government and the Lord'ss Resistance Army , ongoing since 1987. Women have been deliberately targeted with sexual violence during these conflicts, and a study on displaced and conflict-affected populations in Uganda found that women were twice as likely to demonstrate systems of PTSD as well as being four times as likely to show systems of depression. In 2019, Uganda was among the top 5 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 52% increase in its military spending. At the multilateral level, Uganda most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2009-2010.",1985,65,,646M,"NAP Development
The Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD), with support from UN Women and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Uganda, developed a roadmap to developing NAP III.
Prior to the full drafting, MGLSD and UN Women secured the commitment of 28 key government MDAs, religious and cultural institutions, civil society organizations (CSOs), UN Agencies, the media, academia and private sector actors to take part in the development and implementation of the NAPIII.
NAP Implementation
NAP will be implemented through a localisation strategy across different sectors including  government ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), such as the Ministry of Health, and Parliament; local governments; non-governmental organisation (NGOs) and women'ss organizations; community-based organization (CBOs); the media; faith-based organisations (FBOs); cultural institutions; academia and research institutions; donor agencies and development partners; security sector.
Localisation, introduced by CSOs, allows for local ownership and participation for better policy-making and implementation.  Whilst each MDA and CSO has designed operational plans specifying the interventions they will carry out to contribute to NAP III, the MGLSD will be to ensure the coordination of all MDAs and CSOs involved in its implementation.  MGLSD will also design its own operational plans in line with NAP III'ss framework.
NAP monitoring and evaluation
The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will be led by MGLSD, and supported by the Office of Prime Minister (OPM). The National Technical Committee (NTC) will provide technical guidance.
Civil society, MDAs and district local governments will also be invited for annual reporting on their progress.",The implementation period for Uganda'ss NAP is five years (2021-2025).,"The NAP focuses on fifteen medium-term outcomes categorized under four core outcomes.
Core outcome 1: All forms of violence prevented and conflicts resolved (p. 21)
Medium-term outcomes: 
Social cohesion is enhanced
Land related conflicts reduced 
Election related violence reduced 
Inter-ethnic conflicts reduced and peaceful co-existence and cohesion in communities promoted
Core outcome 2: Good governance enhanced at all levels (p. 23)
Medium-term outcomes: 
Increased participation of women in decision making in the security sector 
Social, cultural, and religious norms, values, practices, and perceptions aligned to human rights standards 
Women'ss involvement in dialogues on issues for women peace and security increased
Core outcome 3: Natural and human-made disasters prevented and mitigated (p. 25)
Medium-term outcomes: 
Increased women'ss involvement in environment conservation, natural resource management and climate change mitigation
Improved meaningful participation of women refugees and host communities in decision making for peaceful co-existence 
Increased participation of women in reduction of violent extremism 
Increased women'ss leadership in the prevention and mitigation of emerging viral diseases in vulnerable communities
Core outcome 4: Systems and structures for the implementation and coordination of the NAP III strengthened (p. 27)
Medium-term outcomes: 
NAP III costed and sufficiently resourced
Effective NAP III Coordination mechanisms are established 
Progress on NAP III implementation is regularly and effectively communicated
Key actors are mobilized and engaged in the implementation of the NAP","Each of the four core outcomes has a set of strategic interventions whilst each of the fifteen medium-term outcomes has a set of outputs.
For example, core outcome 3: ‘Natural and human made disasters prevented and mitigated's includes a list of strategic interventions such as (p. 26):
Promote and support women'ss access to climate change related information and information on environmental conservation technologies 
Empower women in refugee settlements and host communities to take on leadership roles and participate in interventions that promote peaceful coexistence. 
Support women groups to gain knowledge and skills in detecting and preventing violent extremism and provide psychosocial support to families affected by violent extremism
Outcome 3 also contains 4 medium-term outcomes, including ‘Increased women'ss leadership in the prevention and mitigation of emerging viral diseases in vulnerable communities's.  Outputs for this medium-term goal are (p. 25): 
Increased knowledge and awareness among women for the prevention and management of emerging viral diseases
Strengthened capacity of actors in gender responsive prevention and mitigation of emerging viral diseases.","Each core outcome, as well as each subset of medium-term outcomes, are given a set of performance indicators, indicator definition and method of analysis, source of information / means of verification, and contributing partner.
For example, Medium-term Outcome 1.4: ‘Interethnic conflicts reduced and peaceful co-existence and cohesion in communities promoted's, has the following (p. 45):
Performance indicator: Level of involvement of women in peacebuilding processes 
Indicator definition, method of analysis: Indicator tracks how women are influencing peacebuilding efforts through their participation in peacebuilding processes, including raising awareness, mediation, negotiation.
Source of information/verification: Perception survey reports
Contributing partners: MIA, MGLSD, CSO","The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan, led by MGLSD, and supported by the OPM and the NTC, is based upon annual reporting by civil society, MDAs and district local governments on their progress.  There will also be a mid-term evaluation in 2023 to assess whether outcomes are being achieved and if any adjustment to the activities is required.  An in-depth external evaluation will be conducted in the final year of implementation, with a new NAP developed from its recommendations.
Performance indicators, which are mostly quantitative, are clearly laid out for each core outcome and medium-term outcome under the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan.  The source of information or means of verification, and contributing partners facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of NAP III by providing sources to assess progress toward indicators and the actors involved.  The medium-term goals and their indicators will be assessed in the 2023 mid-term evaluation.","The output of each medium-term outcome is given an estimated cost in the Ugandan Shilling (UGX), along with a subtotal for each outcome.  
For example, under core outcome 2: ‘Good governance enhanced at all levels's, medium-term Outcome 1 is ‘Increased participation of women in decision making in the Security sector's has the following costs associated (p. 38):  
Gender policies across all security sector institutions passed: 2,035,000,000 UGX
Increased knowledge and awareness of security sector leadership on the transformative role of women'ss participation: 827,068,000 UGX
Systems and structures for the implementation of gender policies in security sector institutions are strengthened: 750,000,000 UGX
Monitoring and evaluation is also allocated a cost of 2,682,923,648 UGX.  The total budget comes to 90,570,166,912 UGX.","Disarmament is addressed briefly in the context of women'ss participation.  Women'ss CSOs participation in disarmament programmes is discussed as an indicator of the outcome ‘Women involvement in dialogues on issues of women, peace and security increased's.  
Under situation analysis, NAP III identified that the National Focal Point on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, is addressing issues of SGBV, indicating that Ugandan officials are already focused to some degree on the gendered impacts of arms and weapons.  This seems to flow naturally from highlighting and addressing the link in the first NAP.  However, NAP III itself does not address SALW, SALW control measures, disarmament, nor the gendered implications of weapons proliferation.","Police Family Protection Units: Services > Health > Protocols and guidelines

For example, Medium-term Outcome 1.4: Interethnic conflicts reduced and peaceful co-existence and cohesion in communities promoted's, has the following p. 45: Performance indicator: Level of involvement of women in peacebuilding processes Indicator definition, method of analysis: Indicator tracks how women are influencing peacebuilding efforts through their participation in peacebuilding processes, including raising awareness, mediation, negotiation. Source of informationverification: Perception survey reports Contributing partners: MIA, MGLSD, CSO The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan, led by MGLSD, and supported by the OPM and the NTC, is based upon annual reporting by civil society, MDAs and district local governments on their progress. There will also be a mid-term evaluation in 2023 to assess whether outcomes are being achieved and if any adjustment to the activities is required. An in-depth external evaluation will be conducted in the final year of implementation, with a new NAP developed from its recommendations. Performance indicators, which are mostly quantitative, are clearly laid out for each core outcome and medium-term outcome under the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan. The source of information or means of verification, and contributing partners facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of NAP III by providing sources to assess progress toward indicators and the actors involved. The medium-term goals and their indicators will be assessed in the 2023 mid-term evaluation. The output of each medium-term outcome is given an estimated cost in the Ugandan Shilling UGX, along with a subtotal for each outcome. For example, under core outcome 2: Good governance enhanced at all levels's, medium-term Outcome 1 is Increased participation of women in decision making in the Security sector's has the following costs associated p. 38: Gender policies across all security sector institutions passed: 2,035,000,000 UGX Increased knowledge and awareness of security sector leadership on the transformative role of women'ss participation: 827,068,000 UGX Systems and structures for the implementation of gender policies in security sector institutions are strengthened: 750,000,000 UGX Monitoring and evaluation is also allocated a cost of 2,682,923,648 UGX. The total budget comes to 90,570,166,912 UGX. Disarmament is addressed briefly in the context of women'ss participation. Women'ss CSOs participation in disarmament programmes is discussed as an indicator of the outcome Women involvement in dialogues on issues of women, peace and security increased's. Under situation analysis, NAP III identified that the National Focal Point on Small Arms and Light Weapons SALW of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, is addressing issues of SGBV, indicating that Ugandan officials are already focused to some degree on the gendered impacts of arms and weapons. This seems to flow naturally from highlighting and addressing the link in the first NAP. However, NAP III itself does not address SALW, SALW control measures, disarmament, nor the gendered implications of weapons proliferation."
184,Ukraine,9,1,1,,,"Ukraine published a second National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2020-2025 after its first NAP, for the period 2016-2020, came to an end. At the end of 2022, however, amidst the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Government of Ukraine launched an initiative to revise their NAP to reflect on the WPS agenda in practice, and learn from prior government initiatives and civil society in how to best update and implement the plan within the changing conflict context. The new NAP, in writing, is a copy of the original 2020-2025 NAP but includes changes noted by: { As amended by the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No.1150-r dated 16.12.2022}. This NAP therefore still has the name end date as the NAP published in 2020, meaning the implementation period is now 2022-2025. The NAP was developed through joint efforts between different national institutions reporting to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda primarily domestically, with an expected focus on the ongoing war. However, it does apply an international lens to issues such as ensuring the training and selection of women for participation in international peacekeeping, as well as peace negotiations. The NAP includes five strategic goals: participation of women in decision-making; resilience to security challenges; post-conflict recovery and transitional justice; combatting gender-based violence and conflict-related sexual violence; and institutional capacity of the national plan actors. Within these strategic goals, operational goals are also identified, which include a ‘task title's, ‘activity title's, the actor(s) responsible for implementation, the time frame for implementation, the source of financing, and the estimated financial resources required for task implementation. The monitoring and evaluation framework for the NAP involved analyzing the key achievement of key indicators and their deviation from target values, determining the reason for their deviation, and conducting an analysis of the implementation status of the tasks and activities in the NAP (p. 13). The collection of information of the indicators's achievement is stated to be the responsibility of central executive bodies, other state bodies involved in the implementation of the NAP, the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, regional state administrations, and the Kyiv and Sevastopol City State Administrations (p.13). The updated NAP includes a slight change in the problem analysis, as well as updated objectives, main target groups and principles of the NAP. The key difference in the problem analysis is outlining issues that have arisen since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. It highlights how since then, almost one third of Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes, and details how this mass displacement disproportionately impacts the lives of women due to the burden of caring for children and other family members requiring care (p.4). An increase in gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, has also been added to the problem analysis, noting that multiple cases have been perpetrated by military personnel of the Russian Federation in all territories of Ukraine that have been liberated (p.5). The NAP then states that Ukraine does not currently have  effective mechanisms to identify security challenges that consider gender aspects, nor is there capacity to inform the wider population about any such issues that arise (p.5). As a result of the change in context, the main target groups and principles were also adjusted. This included referencing the importance of addressing issues relating to: internally displaced persons; persons with limited mobility that live close to the contact line; persons living in combat areas; persons released from captivity; persons staying in temporarily occupied territories; close relatives of combatants or prisoners of war; victims of human trafficking; persons who became disabled due to combat related actions; and persons who suffered material losses due to combat. Essentially, the NAP created a more expansive list of whom it would focus on in recognition of the changed context and the shifting needs of different populations. There is no mention of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in the NAP, nor is there reference to any wider weapons or armament policies. Given the global concern around arms-control and disarmament relating the war, as well as the general consensuses that increased arms availability makes adhering to international law more difficult and also facilitates and aggravates violence against women and girls , the omission of policies that mention this means that these issues remain unaddressed in the NAP.",1981,66,2014,44B,"NAP Development  
According to the document, Ukraine'ss NAP was developed in accordance with national laws on gender equality, the sustainable development goals, and Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. However, there is no explicit mention of which actors participated in the development of the NAP.  
NAP Implementation  
The Ministry of Social Policy in Ukraine is the body that is primarily responsible for the implementation of the NAP. The NAP also includes a comprehensive list of other actors that are responsible, including but not limited to various ministries (the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Science), actors in the security and defense sectors, educational institutions, city administrations, civil associations and international organizations (p.8). Additionally, for each activity title throughout the NAP, a corresponding  actor responsible for implementation is listed.  
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation  
Monitoring of the NAP will be primarily carried out by the Ministry of Social Policy, with information provided by central executive bodies, other state bodies involved in the implementation of the NAP, the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous region of Crimea, regional state administrations, and the Kyiv and Sevastopol City State Administrations (p.13). Together they will collect information on the achievement of indicators set out in the NAP, as well as operational and strategic goals of the NAP. ",The NAP implementation period is 2022-2025.,"The 2022-2025 NAP identifies five strategic goals that set the vision for Ukraine'ss WPS implementation strategy. They include: 
Participation of Women in Decision-Making: ensuring the equal participation of women and men in decision-making on conflict prevention, conflict resolution an post-conflict recovery at all levels and in all areas, including the security and defence sector  
Resilience to Security Challenges: Creating a gender-sensitive system to detect, prevent and respond to security challenges. This involves creating effective mechanisms of interactions of state bodies, public associations, and organizations to respond to security challenges in a way that considers the needs of different groups  
Post-Conflict Recovery and Transitional Justice: Ensuring the process of post-conflict recovery, development and implementation of the transitional justice system based on the principles of ensuring equal rights and opportunities for women and men  
Combating Gender-Based Violence and Conflict-Related Sexual Violence: Providing protection against gender-based violence and sexual violence (in situations of armed conflict and in peacetime) 
Institutional Capacity of the National Plan Actors: Ensuring the developed institutional capacity of the National Plan actors for the effective implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in accordance with international standards  ","Strategic outcomes have a comprehensive set of tasks assigned. These are outlined starting from page 16 of the NAP. It outlines each strategic goal, lists tasks that correspond to this goal, as well as the actor(s) responsible, the time frame for implementation, and the breakdown of the budget for each year of the NAP.  ","Each strategic goal has various indicators attached to it. For example, for Goal 1, ""ensuring equal participation of women and men in decision-making on conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and post-conflict reconstruction at all levels and in all areas”, the following indicators are listed:  
Ukraine'ss place in the UN Women, Peace and Security Index  
The share of women in the security and defense sector  
The share of women in management positions in the defense sector  
The proportion of women participating in international peacekeeping operations in the national contingent  
The proportion of women involved in peace negotiations at the national level  
The number of programs on humanitarian response, peacebuilding and restoration, which were implemented by civil society organizations led by women  
Each indicator is listed alongside a department/group/organization that is responsible for sourcing the information, as well as a section devoted to ""the results of the analysis of factors that had a positive impact on the achievement of progress, or the reasons for the decrease in value of the indicator”.  ","The NAP states that the actors that have been outlined will submit information on the achievement of the indicators of the operational and strategic goals to the Ministry of Social Policy on an annual basis. The ministry will then finalize the information and submit it to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine indicating: the current status of NAP implementation; the share of the indicators and goals achieved; a list of major achievements, as well as areas of concern; and proposals for solving areas of concern (p.14). The NAP also includes the fact that the plan can be updated, if necessary, based on the annual results. The final evaluation of the NAP is expected to be performed during the last year of its implementation, in particular through the following considerations (p.11):  
Analysis of the impact of the NAP'ss implementation on the living conditions of target groups  
Analysis of the achieved key indicators towards the overall goal of the NAP, their deviation from planned markets, and investigation of the reasons for such deviation  
Analysis of the reasonableness and validity of the selected tools for implementation of the NAP, the identified approaches and the need for their revision or extension  
Analysis of the NAP'ss impact on the situation of target groups  ",There is no budget indicated in the NAP.,"Ukraine'ss NAP does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women'ss insecurity.

186,United Kingdom,4,1,1,,,"The 2023-2027 UK NAP was developed by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Ministry of Defense (MOD), and for the first time, includes input from the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office. The NAP was developed in collaboration with civil society organizations, academics and parliamentarians. It outlines five strategic objectives that aim to cut across the four pillars of the WPS agenda (prevention, protection, participation and relief and recovery) (p.10). These include: decision-making; gender-based violence; humanitarian and crisis response; security and justice; and transnational threats. It also includes twelve focus countries, three more than the previous NAP (p.35). The NAP outlines a monitoring and evaluation framework that consists of strategic outcomes and draft indicators (p. 11). It does not include an allocated budget, but indicates that government departments fund work on WPS from their core budgets. Within this, the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) aims to work towards 15% of CSSF fundings being spent on WPS programming (p.36), and £12.5million in new funding being allocated to Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict (PSVI) Programming (p.19). The UK'ss fifth NAP is preceded by four others, adopted in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018, respectively. Compared to the former iterations, the most recent NAP has adopted a broader approach to transnational threats. In the 2018 NAP, a large focus was preventing and countering violent extremism, however the most recent one expands on this to include climate change, cyber threats, and the proliferation of weapons, specifically Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) (p.29). Despite the commitment to considering gender perspectives across SALW policy, mentions of wider disarmament are missing in this NAP, particularly in reference to the consistent transfer and sale of arms from the UK to the Middle East, and more recently, Ukraine. Additionally, the NAP attempts to respond to a critique from civil society about the externalization of the WPS agenda, and discusses domestic strategies in more depth compared to former NAPs (p.8). However, it does not develop the operationalisation of a domestic WPS agenda, and the roles of the devolved governments and civil service of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, are not clear. While Northern Ireland is explicitly mentioned in the NAP – likely due to its recent history with violent conflict – Scotland and Wales are not cited. The four nations of the United Kingdom also have uneven capacities . England, Scotland and Wales, for example, have Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) strategies, whereas Northern Ireland does not. Saying that, the WPS agenda in Wales and Scotland is not particularly institutionalised, and in Northern Ireland, the Assembly is not currently sitting, meaning that nothing can be adopted into law, nor can any political progress be made regarding WPS. These differences, combined with the fact that those responsible for implementing WPS (the MoD and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) are London-based, give the impression that the NAP is England-centric , which raises concerns about the prospect of domestic coherence around the plan. With regards to Northern Ireland, the NAP outlines how the UK seeks to champion and highlight expertise from women peacebuilders in Northern Ireland and continue to support the Women Mediators Across the Commonwealth (WMC) network (p.8, p.15). For context, the most recent history of armed conflict in the UK is the conflict in Northern Ireland, known as ""The Troubles”, which occurred between the 1960s and 1990s. The signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 brought an end to it, with women playing a key role throughout the peace process, especially with the participation of the Northern Ireland Women'ss Coalition in Track I negotiations. The agreement included a provision of securing women'ss rights to full and equal political participation, with a focus on social inclusion, community development and the advancement of women in public life. The contribution of women and women'ss organizations to peacebuilding has always been and remains significant, so the endorsement of women peacebuilders in the country is a welcome inclusion in the NAP. Nonetheless, the focus on Northern Ireland without similar attention to issues in Scotland and Wales risks falsely asserting the boundaries of WPS as a ""conflict-centered” agenda rather than one that realizes gender equality in everyday life. The UK is a contributor to overseas military operations, including in Iraq and Sudan. As of 2022, the UK was among the top ten countries in the world for military spending as a share of GDP, as well as being among the top 10 arms exporters. The UK is also a major contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund, a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. The UK is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2021, the UK was UN Women'ss twelfth largest other resources and regular resources contributor, totalling USD $15.1million. At the multilateral level, the UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.",1986,15,2014,,"NAP Development 
The UK NAP is jointly owned by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and for the first time includes input from the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office. It was also developed across government and in collaboration with UK experts from women'ss rights organizations, as well as wider civil society, academics and parliamentarians. 
NAP Implementation 
The UK takes a whole-of-government approach to WPS. The majority of the UK WPS work is jointly led by FCDO and MOD. Existing UK expertise from the MOD Human Security Advisers and the PSVI Team of Experts will also provide support and guidance (p.11). Relatedly, the UK government will mainstream WPS capability so that there is collective awareness and responsibility across government for policy and programming. This will include a global training offering and investment in research on the gender dynamics of conflict (p.33).
The UK will also establish strategic partnerships, globally and domestically with civil society, women-led organizations, WROs and women peacebuilders in order to implement the NAP (p.32).
The UK will provide a cross-government WPS Helpdesk, which is a call-down facility that provides evidence-informed analysis on WPS issues. The aim is that it will support gender-sensitive conflict and security policy and programming, boosting the UK'ss capacity to implement its NAP (p.34).
The UK will take a coordinated and strategic approach to working with like minded countries and partners to respond to belligerent state and non-state actors. It will prioritize bilateral relationships with such countries in order to build a global network to drive forward implementation of the WPS agenda (p.32). 
The UK also looks to build on past efforts on the multilateral stage, prioritizing alliances with NATO, OSCE, the AU and ASEAN, alongside the UN (p.32). These partnerships are intended to diminish the impact of the push back against gender equality and the rights of women.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The UK Government will provide updates to parliament every two years on the NAP delivery plan and will ensure senior representation at the annual WPS APPG session on NAP progress (p.37). This will be supplemented by baseline study of UK WPS activity, with impact evaluations taking place after 1, 2.5, and 5 years. The UK has set out draft indicators but these will be finalized during the baseline evaluation after Year 1 (p.37). The UK Government will work with the WPS All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) and civil society to respond to concerns and scrutiny (p.37).
 WILPF 
The Gender Action for Peace and Security (GAPS) UK is the most prominent organization that worked to develop the NAP. It is a membership network of civil society organizations including WILPF UK. Generally, as articulated in their response to the 5th UK NAP, GAPS are pleased to see a more holistic approach adopted in the most recent NAP, but are concerned about implementation because of current government dynamics in the UK. WILPF UK contributed to the NAP process through GAPS UK.",The NAP implementation period is five years (2023-2027).,"The 2023-2027 NAP identifies five strategic outcomes which set the vision for the UK WPS implementation strategy. These strategic outcomes have been selected for their contributions to the four pillars of WPS, their relevance across the UK'ss broader foreign, development, defence and security policies, the UK'ss expertise and influence, and their ability to respond to emerging threats and the current global context. They include: 
(1) Decision-making: increasing women'ss meaningful participation, leadership and representation in decision-making processes 
(2) Gender-based violence: preventing GBV, including conflict-related sexual violence, and supporting survivors to cope, recover and seek justice 
(3) Humanitarian and crisis response: supporting the needs of women and girls in crises and ensuring they can participate and lead in responses 
(4) Security and justice: increasing the accountability of security and justice actors to women and girls and ensuring they are responsive to their rights and needs
(5) Transnational threats: ensuring response to the needs of women and girls as part of the approach to transnational threats ","Strategic outcomes have a comprehensive set of actions assigned. These are outlined in Annex A of the NAP (p. 38-47). It goes through all five strategic objectives, and lists the priority, the commitment, and the organizational lead for the action.","The NAP currently only has draft indicators for each strategic objective, which will be finalized during the writing and publication of the Year 1 report. These indicators are split into ‘departmental's and ‘focus countries's. Examples of these indicators are below: 
SO1: % of UK diplomatic roles held by a woman; % of peace agreements supported by the UK that secure gender provisions within the agreement or implementation plan; % of women politicians increases as a result of UK political leverage (p.39).
SO2: Number of people benefiting from GBV prevention or response through FCDO; number of women and girls being supported to access UK funded GBV services by country (p. 41). 
SO3: % of humanitarian programmes with an OECD DAC Gender Marker of 1 or 2; annual UK funding for humanitarian interventions which have been adapted to target women, girls and/including survivors of GBV (p. 42). 
SO4: % of UK security sector projects and programmes, including disarmament and defectors programmes; % of CRSV cases brought forward that lead to successful prosecution under domestic law (p. 43). 
SO5: % of CSSF and NCP cyber programmes accounting for diversity and gender equality considerations; % of programmes that address transnational security threats (p. 45). ","For the 2023-2027 NAP, the UK adopts a monitoring and evaluation process that is measured on a two-yearly basis across Government departments. It includes reports to parliament through external assessments. The UK has published draft indicators, but will use the evaluation process in a responsive way through the lifespan of the NAP, remaining open to findings of external reports and adjusting monitoring and evaluation processes as needed.","UK Government departments fund work on WPS from their core budgets, such as the FCO'ss Global Britain Fund, and cross-government funds including CSSF. The CSSF aims to work towards 15% of CSSF fundings being spent on WPS programming (p.36), and £12.5million in new funding is being allocated to Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict (PSVI) Programming (p.19). 
 ","The NAP minimally references SALW, noting that their diversion and misuse can fuel conflict and crime, with particular impacts on women and girls (p.29). However, there are no wider mentions of disarmament.",,1,Western Europe,"The 2023-2027 UK NAP was developed by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office FCDO and the Ministry of Defense MOD, and for the first time, includes input from the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office. The NAP was developed in collaboration with civil society organizations, academics and parliamentarians. It outlines five strategic objectives that aim to cut across the four pillars of the WPS agenda prevention, protection, participation and relief and recovery p.10. These include: decision-making; gender-based violence; humanitarian and crisis response; security and justice; and transnational threats. It also includes twelve focus countries, three more than the previous NAP p.35. The NAP outlines a monitoring and evaluation framework that consists of strategic outcomes and draft indicators p. 11. It does not include an allocated budget, but indicates that government departments fund work on WPS from their core budgets. Within this, the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund CSSF aims to work towards 15 of CSSF fundings being spent on WPS programming p.36, and 12.5million in new funding being allocated to Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict PSVI Programming p.19. The UK'ss fifth NAP is preceded by four others, adopted in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018, respectively. Compared to the former iterations, the most recent NAP has adopted a broader approach to transnational threats. In the 2018 NAP, a large focus was preventing and countering violent extremism, however the most recent one expands on this to include climate change, cyber threats, and the proliferation of weapons, specifically Small Arms and Light Weapons SALW p.29. Despite the commitment to considering gender perspectives across SALW policy, mentions of wider disarmament are missing in this NAP, particularly in reference to the consistent transfer and sale of arms from the UK to the Middle East, and more recently, Ukraine. Additionally, the NAP attempts to respond to a critique from civil society about the externalization of the WPS agenda, and discusses domestic strategies in more depth compared to former NAPs p.8. However, it does not develop the operationalisation of a domestic WPS agenda, and the roles of the devolved governments and civil service of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, are not clear. While Northern Ireland is explicitly mentioned in the NAP  likely due to its recent history with violent conflict  Scotland and Wales are not cited. The four nations of the United Kingdom also have uneven capacities . England, Scotland and Wales, for example, have Violence Against Women and Girls VAWG strategies, whereas Northern Ireland does not. Saying that, the WPS agenda in Wales and Scotland is not particularly institutionalised, and in Northern Ireland, the Assembly is not currently sitting, meaning that nothing can be adopted into law, nor can any political progress be made regarding WPS. These differences, combined with the fact that those responsible for implementing WPS the MoD and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office are London-based, give the impression that the NAP is England-centric , which raises concerns about the prospect of domestic coherence around the plan. With regards to Northern Ireland, the NAP outlines how the UK seeks to champion and highlight expertise from women peacebuilders in Northern Ireland and continue to support the Women Mediators Across the Commonwealth WMC network p.8, p.15. For context, the most recent history of armed conflict in the UK is the conflict in Northern Ireland, known as ""The Troubles, which occurred between the 1960s and 1990s. The signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 brought an end to it, with women playing a key role throughout the peace process, especially with the participation of the Northern Ireland Women'ss Coalition in Track I negotiations. The agreement included a provision of securing women'ss rights to full and equal political participation, with a focus on social inclusion, community development and the advancement of women in public life. The contribution of women and women'ss organizations to peacebuilding has always been and remains significant, so the endorsement of women peacebuilders in the country is a welcome inclusion in the NAP. Nonetheless, the focus on Northern Ireland without similar attention to issues in Scotland and Wales risks falsely asserting the boundaries of WPS as a ""conflict-centered agenda rather than one that realizes gender equality in everyday life. The UK is a contributor to overseas military operations, including in Iraq and Sudan. As of 2022, the UK was among the top ten countries in the world for military spending as a share of GDP, as well as being among the top 10 arms exporters. The UK is also a major contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women'ss Peace and Humanitarian Fund, a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. The UK is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2021, the UK was UN Women'ss twelfth largest other resources and regular resources contributor, totalling USD 15.1million. At the multilateral level, the UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The 2023-2027 NAP identifies five strategic outcomes which set the vision for the UK WPS implementation strategy. These strategic outcomes have been selected for their contributions to the four pillars of WPS, their relevance across the UK'ss broader foreign, development, defence and security policies, the UK'ss expertise and influence, and their ability to respond to emerging threats and the current global context. They include: 1 Decision-making: increasing women'ss meaningful participation, leadership and representation in decision-making processes 2 Gender-based violence: preventing GBV, including conflict-related sexual violence, and supporting survivors to cope, recover and seek justice 3 Humanitarian and crisis response: supporting the needs of women and girls in crises and ensuring they can participate and lead in responses 4 Security and justice: increasing the accountability of security and justice actors to women and girls and ensuring they are responsive to their rights and needs 5 Transnational threats: ensuring response to the needs of women and girls as part of the approach to transnational threats Strategic outcomes have a comprehensive set of actions assigned. These are outlined in Annex A of the NAP p. 38-47. It goes through all five strategic objectives, and lists the priority, the commitment, and the organizational lead for the action. The NAP currently only has draft indicators for each strategic objective, which will be finalized during the writing and publication of the Year 1 report. These indicators are split into departmental's and focus countries's. Examples of these indicators are below: SO1:  of UK diplomatic roles held by a woman;  of peace agreements supported by the UK that secure gender provisions within the agreement or implementation plan;  of women politicians increases as a result of UK political leverage p.39. SO2: Number of people benefiting from GBV prevention or response through FCDO; number of women and girls being supported to access UK funded GBV services by country p. 41. SO3:  of humanitarian programmes with an OECD DAC Gender Marker of 1 or 2; annual UK funding for humanitarian interventions which have been adapted to target women, girls andincluding survivors of GBV p. 42. SO4:  of UK security sector projects and programmes, including disarmament and defectors programmes;  of CRSV cases brought forward that lead to successful prosecution under domestic law p. 43. SO5:  of CSSF and NCP cyber programmes accounting for diversity and gender equality considerations;  of programmes that address transnational security threats p. 45. For the 2023-2027 NAP, the UK adopts a monitoring and evaluation process that is measured on a two-yearly basis across Government departments. It includes reports to parliament through external assessments. The UK has published draft indicators, but will use the evaluation process in a responsive way through the lifespan of the NAP, remaining open to findings of external reports and adjusting monitoring and evaluation processes as needed. UK Government departments fund work on WPS from their core budgets, such as the FCO'ss Global Britain Fund, and cross-government funds including CSSF. The CSSF aims to work towards 15 of CSSF fundings being spent on WPS programming p.36, and 12.5million in new funding is being allocated to Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict PSVI Programming p.19.

The Interinstitutional Working Group, created by Ministerial Resolution 296/20 on July 29th, 2020, developed the NAP. It included personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Interior Ministry, the National Defense Ministry, the Human Rights Secretariat, and the Women'ss National Institute; it was supported by staff from Inclusive Security and UN Women.
Implementation
The Foreign Affairs Ministry, National Defense Ministry, Interior Ministry, Human Rights Secretariat, and the Women'ss National Institute in the Social Development Ministry are responsible for the implementation of the NAP. 
Monitoring and Evaluation
The Interinstitutional Working Group that created the NAP is responsible for monitoring and evaluation as well.
Civil Society Organizations
The Interinstitutional Working Group that formulated the NAP is not reported to have included the participation of CSOs, although there are some mentions of CSOs throughout the document.",The timeframe for the implementation of the NAP is from 2021 to 2024.,"Due to the Uruguayan national experience as well as the principles that led their foreign policy, and their participation in international organizations, three objectives were outlined for the NAP.
Promote a gender perspective in all peace and security activities.
Promote a focus on human security, with a gender perspective.
Strengthen the capacity for responsiveness on the international level in relation to the WPS agenda and Protection of Civilians in Peace Operations, in order to make societies more fair, peaceful, and inclusive.","The NAP outlines a number of proposed actions and activities, which span across the four pillars of the WPS agenda. 
As the participation of Uruguay in Peacekeeping Operations is a key element of their foreign policy, there are several proposed actions to include the WPS agenda in this work, including:
Increasing women'ss participation in Peacekeeping operations
Developing specific actions to overcome obstacles and increase women'ss participation in Peacekeeping Operations and public life.
Broadcasting Uruguay'ss experiences, lessons, and good practices in Peacekeeping Operations
Promoting humanitarian and human rights focus on civil society protection in Uruguay, particularly in the context of armed conflict.
The WPS agenda is considered a key topic for international cooperation and Uruguay seeks to promote it through its foreign policy, with actions such as:
Promote conflict resolution and conflict prevention abilities and capabilities in international fora, like the participation in the Network of Women Mediators of the Southern Cone.
Promote regional and international initiatives about the WPS agenda. 
Sharing experiences and good practices on the WPS agenda with regional and international partners, including gender equality, GBV prevention, and the WPS agenda in bilateral dialogue and promoting the WPS agenda through active participation in regional and international forums 
At the national level, Uruguay'ss NAP is focused on: 
Promoting the WPS agenda at the national level for all Government institutions, through the promotion of courses on Gender-awareness for the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior, the provision of  education on WPS and other related issues within the Government personnel, and the incorporation of training and qualification on the WPS agenda for diplomats and members of the MFA
Include gender analysis in all State activities related to peace and security
Promote the human security focus with a gender perspective in government institutions.
Promote the WPS agenda at the national level through the broadcasting of the NAP through a media plan and the promotion of activities about the WPS agenda in the International Relations major in Uruguay'ss Universities.
Promote cybersecurity with a gender perspective among youth","To ensure the implementation of the Action Plan, Uruguay proposes a series of means of verification as key indicators of the execution of the proposed actions. Due to the wide spectrum of activities proposed, the means of verification are also diverse, and include: 
the minutes of activities carried out, such as conferences, workshops, bilateral and multilateral meetings, etc; the lists of training attendees and graduates of courses, trainings and workshops; the number of research articles on WPS published between 2021 and 2024, the number of spots or advertising campaigns focused on the diffusion of the WPS at the national level, the number of reports of the implementation of the NAP, etc.","The Interinstitutional Working Group, who is the responsible actor for the M&E of the implementation of the NAP, has three main tools to realize such task:
The digital platform SIMORE will be used to evaluate the implementation of the planned actions and their short-term results. On this platform it is possible to establish the activities for all government levels and the timeframe to execute them, and as the information is provided by local authorities, it facilitates reporting. 
Mid-term reports will be delivered every six months, as a result of the follow up of the Interinstitutional Working Group on the implementation of the NAP.
A final report will be further used to structure the next NAP for Uruguay.","There is no specific financing or budget for each activity, as each Government office is responsible to realize their activities with their general budget, however, the NAP states that the MFA must identify extra funding opportunities.","Although there are no specific proposals on disarmament, Uruguay considers that the support to disarmament mechanisms is a key principle of their national defense policy that also supports the Uruguayan Foreign Policy, along with the support for the maintaining of international peace and security, the proscription of the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and support for dialogue and peace.
