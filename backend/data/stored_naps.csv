Afghanistan,"**Contextual & Comparative Analysis**

The revised NAP for Afghanistan will directly focus on addressing gender inequalities in the domestic and workplace spheres. By improving legislative and policy frameworks, the NAP aims to enhance women's rights, economic participation, and safety in these critical areas. Comparing key statistics with neighbouring countries like Albania and Croatia provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for Afghanistan:

- Proportion of women subjected to physical and/or sexual violence:
  - Afghanistan: 35.0%
  - Albania: 24.4%
  - Croatia: 21.3%
  - Insight: Afghanistan faces significantly higher rates of violence against women compared to neighbouring countries, indicating a pressing need for stronger protective measures.

- Mean age at first marriage, female:
  - Afghanistan: 21.5
  - Albania: 29.0
  - Croatia: 29.5
  - Insight: Afghanistan has a lower mean age at first marriage for females compared to Albania and Croatia, suggesting potential vulnerabilities for young women.

- Women making informed decisions on sexual relations and reproductive health:
  - Afghanistan: N/A
  - Albania: 61%
  - Croatia: N/A
  - Insight: Lack of data in Afghanistan highlights potential gaps in women's agency over sexual and reproductive health compared to Albania.

Legislative gaps in Afghanistan constrain women's rights and safety, evident from the absence of laws on sexual harassment in employment and equal immovable property ownership rights. These gaps hinder gender equality and contribute to higher rates of violence against women. Albania's legislation addressing sexual harassment in employment and property ownership rights provides a benchmark for improving legal protections for women in Afghanistan.

**Legislative & Policy Gap Assessment**

- Missing Law: Sexual Harassment Law to Protect Women and Children
  - Peer Example: Albania's Law no. 136/2015 Prevent Sexual Harassment in the Workplace
  - Impact: Albania's law prohibits workplace harassment, ensuring safer working environments for women and promoting gender equality.

The absence of specific laws in Afghanistan, as seen through the legislative gaps, contributes to the challenges faced by women in the domestic and workplace settings. Bridging these gaps and aligning with the legal provisions from peer countries can strengthen protections for Afghan women.

**Improvement Plan for the Existing NAP**

Key Issues:
1. Lack of gender-responsive budgeting
2. Inadequate disarmament-related measures

Proposed Amendments:
1. Establish a Gender Budgeting Unit within the Ministry of Finance to ensure funds are allocated equitably.
2. Introduce a clause for Small Arms Risk Assessment under disarmament to mitigate weapons-related threats to women's security.
3. Re-align Indicators: Rewrite indicators like ""Increased awareness among military personnel"" as SMART targets to enhance monitoring efficiency.

**Peer-Practice Recommendations**

For gender-responsive budgeting, the best practice is seen in Albania, where the introduction of a Gender Budgeting Unit led to increased financial allocations for women-centric projects, resulting in enhanced gender equality outcomes.

**GII Ranking & Resource Realignment**

Afghanistan's high GII rank underscores the urgency to prioritize objectives that address maternal mortality, early childbirth, and female parliamentary representation. Resource realignment should focus on reallocating a small portion of military expenditure towards gender-sensitive projects to advance women's rights.

**Incorporating Personal Experiences**

The narratives of women facing societal barriers underscore the importance of empowering women economically. Policies should focus on economic empowerment initiatives to combat violence against women and promote gender equality.

United States,"**Context & Comparative Analysis**

*Insights:*
1. The proportion of women subjected to physical and/or sexual violence in the United States is relatively low compared to the Cluster average and the Region average, indicating a better situation in terms of violence against women.
2. The United States has legislation on sexual harassment in employment, equal immovable property ownership rights for women and men, and women making their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations and reproductive health care, aligning with or exceeding the Region average in these areas.
3. The mean age at first marriage for females in the United States is not available for comparison, which may impact women's workforce entry and other opportunities.

*Comparative Analysis:*
- When compared to neighboring or socio-politically similar countries, the United States may draw insights from countries like Canada and the United Kingdom, which have similar levels of gender equality and progressive legislation in place.

**Legislative Gap Assessment**

- The United States does not have specific legislation addressing violence against women in the provided data, unlike peer countries like Canada with the ""Violence Against Women Act"" and the United Kingdom with the ""Domestic Abuse Bill"". Implementing similar laws can lead to improved outcomes in combating violence against women.

- The United States can consider adopting legislation similar to Canada's ""Violence Against Women Act"" to address violence against women comprehensively and the United Kingdom's ""Domestic Abuse Bill"" to enhance protections for victims of domestic violence. These laws focus on providing support services, legal remedies, and prevention strategies to combat gender-based violence effectively.

**Writing the NAP**

*Draft NAP for the United States:*

**Clear Objectives:**
1. Enhance identity rights by promoting recognition and respect for diverse gender identities.
2. Improve healthcare access and quality for women, especially in marginalized communities.
3. Enhance educational opportunities and gender equality in educational settings.

**Time-bound Actions & Actors:**
- Establish a task force comprising government officials, NGOs, and experts to oversee the implementation of the NAP.
- Conduct a nationwide awareness campaign on gender identity rights within the next 6 months.

**Peer-Practice Recommendations:**
- Learn from Canada's ""Violence Against Women Act"" in addressing violence against women comprehensively.
- Adopt the United Kingdom's ""Domestic Abuse Bill"" to enhance protections for victims of domestic violence.

**GII Ranking Analysis:**
- The United States should prioritize maternal healthcare to improve its GII ranking.
- Increasing female participation in decision-making bodies can positively impact the GII ranking.
- Enhancing educational opportunities for women can contribute to reducing gender inequality.

**Incorporating Personal Experiences:**
